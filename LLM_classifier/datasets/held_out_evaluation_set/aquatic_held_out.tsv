Samples were taken monthly on average dividing particle-associated (greater than 5.0um) and free-living (less than 5.0um, greater than 0.2um) microbes in the water column and in two lakes in the sediment. The lakes are all located closely to each other but differ in many physicochemical parameters such as pH and conductivity. Thus, similarities as well as dissimilarities of microbial communities are of high interest.

MGYS00004180	Pyrosequencing reveals highly diverse and species-specific microbial communities in sponges from the Red Sea	Marine sponges are associated with a remarkable array of microorganisms. Using a tag pyrosequencing technology, this study was the first to deeply investigate the microbial communities associated with three Red Sea sponges, Hyrtios erectus, Stylissa carteri, and Xestospongia testudinaria. We revealed highly diverse sponge-associated bacterial communities with up to 1,000 microbial OTUs and an estimate of up to 2,000 species. Altogether 26 bacterial phyla were detected from the Red Sea sponges, 11 of which were absent from the surrounding seawater and 4 of which were recorded in sponges for the first time. Up to 100 OTUs with an estimate of up to 300 archaeal species were revealed from a single sponge species. This is by far the highest diversity ever recorded for sponges. A non-negligible proportion of unclassified reads in sponges may represent the presence of novel species. Our results demonstrated that the sponge-associated microbial communities remained highly consistent in the same sponge species from different locations although they varied to certain degrees among different sponge species. A significant proportion of the tag sequences from the sponges could be assigned into one of the sponge-specific clusters previously defined. In addition, the sponge-associated microbial communities were consistently diverged from those in the surrounding seawater. Our results suggested the Red Sea sponges possess highly sponge-species specific microbial communities which are resistant to environmental influence. Although sponges have been regarded as microbial fermenters with a huge microbial diversity being reported among the animal kingdom, much of their microbial diversity remains to be explored.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	21085196	Pyrosequencing reveals highly diverse and species-specific microbial communities in sponges from the Red Sea.

MGYS00005709	Moorea Reef Archaea and Eukaryota gene survey	The Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER (17.50 S, 149.83 W) is comprised of the coastal fringe of coral reefs and lagoons that surround the volcanic island of Moorea in the society islands of French Polynesia. The MCR LTER project is co-managed by the University of California Santa Barbara and California State University, Northridge, and field operations are conducted from the University of California Berkeley''s Gump Research Station situated on Cooks Bay. Primary research interests include studies of population dynamics of local corals, nutrient dynamics and diversity studies. For the MCR portion of the MIRADA project we have incorporated investigators from the Marine Biological Laboratory, UCSB faculty, faculty at Moorea''s Gump research station, the Sea Education Association''s semester at sea cruise, and have incorporated an NSF REU undergraduate in 2009 for water sampling and sample analyses. The fringing reefs off the MCR LTER lie at the interface between populated terrestrial coastlines and unproductive, oligotrophic oceanic waters. Our goal within the MIRADA project is to study the changes in microbial population patters along a transect from the island, through Cooks Bay, into the lagoon and across the fringing reef into the open ocean. In 2008 and 2009 the Marine Biological Laboratory MIRADA project partnered with the Sea Education Association to undertake offshore water sampling and geochemical analyses, incorporating an REU student in the 2009 cruise and subsequent laboratory sample analyses. We are primarily interested in the effects of the island and the fringing reef on the microbial population in terms of diversity, species richness, and correlations of specific microbial groups with local geochemical conditions. We are also interested in seasonal comparisons from samples taken in January, 2008 (summer, rainy season) and samples from the same stations collected in June, 2009 (winter, dry season) to assess the impacts of anthropogenic inputs on near- and off-shore communities. We will look for the presence of landscape-scale patterns of diversity and richness from near shore, lagoon and offshore microbial communities within all three domains, signature communities representative of specific geographic and geochemical milieu, and the co-occurrence of specific groups within the ecosystem. Preliminary sequence data analyses suggest that there is a significant correlation between the geographical region (bay, lagoon, offshore open water) and bacterial sequence diversity. We found that significant differences in community diversity can be identified from samples taken from inside and outside the fringing reef, as well as those taken from the bay and the adjacent lagoon. In further analyses we hope to identify seasonal profiles and include environmental variables to assess the breadth of this pattern. We are also in the process of completing a seasonal comparison of the MCR LTER cyanobacterial community using v6 rRNA and ntcA gene sequence data, as well as gene sequences culled from the Global Ocean Survey metagenomic dataset samples that were collected in close proximity to our offshore sites. This data can then be compared to other coastal ocean MIRADA LTER sites (e.g. Palmer Station, Santa Barbara Coastal and Virginia Coast Reserve) to identify patterns in nearshore and coastal ocean microbial populations.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal	21900967	An all-taxon microbial inventory of the Moorea coral reef ecosystem.	The Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Site (17.50S, 149.83W) comprises the fringe of coral reefs and lagoons surrounding the volcanic island of Moorea in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. As part of our Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic LTERS biodiversity inventory project, we characterized microbial community composition across all three domains of life using amplicon pyrosequencing of the V6 (bacterial and archaeal) and V9 (eukaryotic) hypervariable regions of small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Our survey spanned eight locations along a 130-km transect from the reef lagoon to the open ocean to examine changes in communities along inshore to offshore gradients. Our results illustrate consistent community differentiation between inshore and offshore ecosystems across all three domains, with greater richness in all domains in the reef-associated habitats. Bacterial communities were more homogenous among open ocean sites spanning &gt;100 km than among inshore sites separated by &lt;1 km, whereas eukaryotic communities varied more offshore than inshore, and archaea showed more equal levels of dissimilarity among subhabitats. We identified signature communities representative of specific geographic and geochemical milieu, and characterized co-occurrence patterns of specific microbial taxa within the inshore ecosystem including several bacterial groups that persist in geographical niches across time. Bacterial and archaeal communities were dominated by few abundant taxa but spatial patterning was consistent through time and space in both rare and abundant communities. This is the first in-depth inventory analysis of biogeographic variation of all three microbial domains within a coral reef ecosystem.

Diazotrophic communities make an essential contribution to the productivity through providing new nitrogen. However, knowledge of the roles that both mangrove tree species and geochemical parameters play in shaping mangove rhizosphere diazotrophic communities is still elusive. Here, a comprehensive examination of the diversity and structure of microbial communities in the rhizospheres of three mangrove species, <i>Rhizophora apiculata</i>, <i>Avicennia marina</i>, and <i>Ceriops tagal</i>, was undertaken using high<b>-</b>throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and <i>nifH</i> genes. Our results revealed a great diversity of both the total microbial composition and the diazotrophic composition specifically in the mangrove rhizosphere. <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> were both ubiquitous and dominant, comprising an average of 45.87 and 86.66% of total microbial and diazotrophic communities, respectively. Sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the <i>Desulfobacteraceae</i> and <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i> were the dominant diazotrophs. Community statistical analyses suggested that both mangrove tree species and additional environmental variables played important roles in shaping total microbial and potential diazotroph communities in mangrove rhizospheres. In contrast to the total microbial community investigated by analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, most of the dominant diazotrophic groups identified by <i>nifH</i> gene sequences were significantly different among mangrove species. The dominant diazotrophs of the family <i>Desulfobacteraceae</i> were positively correlated with total phosphorus, but negatively correlated with the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio. The <i>Pseudomonadaceae</i> were positively correlated with the concentration of available potassium, suggesting that diazotrophs potentially play an important role in biogeochemical cycles, such as those of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and potassium, in the mangrove ecosystem.

Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which can preserve the signatures of present and past infections.

Pharmaceuticals and personal care products, including antimicrobials, can be found at trace levels in treated wastewater effluent. Impacts of chemical contaminants on coastal aquatic microbial community structure and pathogen abundance are unknown despite the potential for selection through antimicrobial resistance. In particular, <i>Vibrio</i>, a marine bacterial genus that includes several human pathogens, displays resistance to the ubiquitous antimicrobial compound triclosan. Here we demonstrated through use of natural seawater microcosms that triclosan (at a concentration of ~5 ppm) can induce a significant <i>Vibrio</i> growth response (68-1,700 fold increases) in comparison with no treatment controls for three distinct coastal ecosystems: Looe Key Reef (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), Doctors Arm Canal (Big Pine Key, FL), and Clam Bank Landing (North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC). Additionally, microbial community analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for Looe Key Reef showed distinct changes in microbial community structure with exposure to 5 ppm triclosan, with increases observed in the relative abundance of Vibrionaceae (17-fold), Pseudoalteromonadaceae (65-fold), Alteromonadaceae (108-fold), Colwelliaceae (430-fold), and Oceanospirillaceae (1,494-fold). While the triclosan doses tested were above concentrations typically observed in coastal surface waters, results identify bacterial families that are potentially resistant to triclosan and/or adapted to use triclosan as a carbon source. The results further suggest the potential for selection of <i>Vibrio</i> in coastal environments, especially sediments, where triclosan may accumulate at high levels.

Microorganisms inhabiting saline environments are an interesting ecological model for the study of the adaptation of organisms to extreme living conditions and constitute a precious resource of enzymes and bioproducts for biotechnological applications. We analyzed the microbial communities in nine ponds with increasing salt concentrations (salinity range 4.9-36.0%) of the Saltern of Margherita di Savoia (Italy), the largest thalassohaline saltern in Europe. A deep-metabarcoding NGS procedure addressing separately the V5-V6 and V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene of <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Archaea</i>, respectively, and a CARD-FISH (catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization) analysis allowed us to profile the dynamics of microbial populations at the different salt concentrations. Both the domains were detected throughout the saltern, even if the low relative abundance of <i>Archaea</i> in the three ponds with the lowest salinities prevented the construction of the relative amplicon libraries. The highest cell counts were recorded at 14.5% salinity for <i>Bacteria</i> and at 24.1% salinity for <i>Archaea</i>. While <i>Bacteria</i> showed the greatest number of genera in the first ponds (salinity range 4.9-14.5%), archaeal genera were more numerous in the last ponds of the saltern (salinity 24.1-36.0%). Among prokaryotes, <i>Salinibacter</i> was the genus with the maximum abundance (~49% at 34.6% salinity). Other genera detected at high abundance were the archaeal <i>Haloquadratum</i> (~43% at 36.0% salinity) and <i>Natronomonas</i> (~18% at 13.1% salinity) and the bacterial "<i>Candidatus</i> Aquiluna" (~19% at 14.5% salinity). Interestingly, "<i>Candidatus</i> Aquiluna" had not been identified before in thalassohaline waters.

MGYS00004599	Microbial communities associated with Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora vegetated sediments in Louisiana saltmarshes	"Saltmarshes are typically dominated by perennial grasses with large underground rhizome systems that can change local sediment conditions and be important in shaping the sediment microbial community. Factors that control plant zonation in saltmarshes (e.g. salinity) are also likely to influence the microbial community, but little is known as to whether microbial communities share distribution patterns with plants in these systems. To determine the extent to which microbial assemblages are influenced by saltmarsh plant communities, as well as to examine patterns in microbial community structure at local and regional scales, we sampled sediments at three saltmarshes in Louisiana, USA. All three systems exhibit a patchy distribution of Juncus roemerianus stands within a Spartina alterniflora marsh. Sediment samples were collected from the interior of several J. roemerianus stands as well as from the S. alterniflora matrix. Samples were assayed for extracellular enzyme activity and DNA extracted to determine microbial community composition. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of rRNA gene fragments was used to determine regional patterns in bacterial, archaeal, and fungal assemblages, while Illumina sequencing was used to examine local, vegetation-driven, patterns in community structure at one site. Both enzyme activity and microbial community structure were primarily influenced by regional site. Within individual saltmarshes, bacterial and archaeal communities differed between J. roemerianus and S. alterniflora vegetated sediments, while fungal communities did not. These results highlight the importance of the plant community in shaping the sediment microbial community in saltmarshes, but also demonstrate that regional scale factors are at least as important."	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Salt marsh

Estuarine sediments are significant repositories of anthropogenic contaminants, and thus knowledge of the impacts of pollution upon microbial communities in these environments is important to understand potential effects on estuaries as a whole. The Lagos lagoon (Nigeria) is one of Africa's largest estuarine ecosystems, and is impacted by hydrocarbon pollutants and other industrial and municipal wastes. The goal of this study was to elucidate microbial community structure in Lagos lagoon sediments to identify groups that may be adversely affected by pollution, and those that may serve as degraders of environmental contaminants, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sediment samples were collected from sites that ranged in types and levels of anthropogenic impacts. The sediments were characterized for a range of physicochemical properties, and microbial community structure was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Microbial diversity (species richness and evenness) in the Apapa and Eledu sediments was reduced compared to that of the Ofin site, and communities of both of the former two were dominated by a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assigned to the family Helicobacteraceae (Epsilonproteobacteria). In the Ofin community, Epsilonproteobacteria were minor constituents, while the major groups were Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, which were all minor in the Apapa and Eledu sediments. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD), a broad indicator of contamination, was identified by multivariate analyses as strongly correlated with variation in alpha diversity. Environmental variables that explained beta diversity patterns included SOD, as well as levels of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, cobalt, cadmium, total organic matter, or nitrate. Of 582 OTU identified, abundance of 167 was significantly correlated (false discovery rate q<= 0.05) to environmental variables. The largest group of OTU correlated with PAH levels were PAH/hydrocarbon-degrading genera of the Oceanospirillales order (Gammaproteobacteria), which were most abundant in the hydrocarbon-contaminated Apapa sediment. Similar Oceanospirillales taxa are responsive to marine oil spills and thus may present a unifying theme in marine microbiology as bacteria adapted for degradation of high hydrocarbon loads, and may represent a potential means for intrinsic remediation in the case of the Lagos lagoon sediments.

MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource. Recently, an updated approach to data analysis has been unveiled (version 5.0), replacing the previous single pipeline with multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to the input data, and that are formally described using the Common Workflow Language, enabling greater provenance, reusability, and reproducibility. MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their enriched annotations.

Marine sediments harbor complex microbial communities that remain poorly studied relative to other biomes such as seawater. Moreover, bacteria in these communities produce antibiotics and other bioactive secondary metabolites, yet little is known about how these compounds affect microbial community structure. In this study, we used next-generation amplicon sequencing to assess native microbial community composition in shallow tropical marine sediments. The results revealed complex communities comprised of largely uncultured taxa, with considerable spatial heterogeneity and known antibiotic producers comprising only a small fraction of the total diversity. Organic extracts from cultured strains of the sediment-dwelling actinomycete genus Salinispora were then used in mesocosm studies to address how secondary metabolites shape sediment community composition. We identified predatory bacteria and other taxa that were consistently reduced in the extract-treated mesocosms, suggesting that they may be the targets of allelopathic interactions. We tested related taxa for extract sensitivity and found general agreement with the culture-independent results. Conversely, several taxa were enriched in the extract-treated mesocosms, suggesting that some bacteria benefited from the interactions. The results provide evidence that bacterial secondary metabolites can have complex and significant effects on sediment microbial communities. Ocean sediments represent one of Earth's largest and most poorly studied biomes. These habitats are characterized by complex microbial communities where competition for space and nutrients can be intense. This study addressed the hypothesis that secondary metabolites produced by the sediment-inhabiting actinomycete Salinispora arenicola affect community composition and thus mediate interactions among competing microbes. Next-generation amplicon sequencing of mesocosm experiments revealed complex communities that shifted following exposure to S. arenicola extracts. The results reveal that certain predatory bacteria were consistently less abundant following exposure to extracts, suggesting that microbial metabolites mediate competitive interactions. Other taxa increased in relative abundance, suggesting a benefit from the extracts themselves or the resulting changes in the community. This study takes a first step toward assessing the impacts of bacterial metabolites on sediment microbial communities. The results provide insight into how low-abundance organisms may help structure microbial communities in ocean sediments.																																													
MGYS00005715	Biogeography of Arctic picoeukaryotes during summer of 2012	Information on recent photosynthetic biomass distribution and biogeography of Arctic marine pico-eukaryotes (0.2  3 m) are needed to better understand consequences of environmental change for Arctic marine ecosystems. We analysed pico-eukaryote biomass and community composition in Fram Strait and larger parts of the central Arctic Ocean (Nansen Basin, Amundsen Basin) by chlorophyll a (Chl a) measurements, Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), and 454-pyrosequencing. Samples were collected during summer 2012, the year with the latest record sea ice minimum. Chl a values were highest in eastern Fram Strait and pico-plankton accounted for 60-90% of Chl a biomass during the observation period. ARISA-patterns and 454-pyrosequencing revealed, that pico-eukaryote distribution is closely related to water mass distribution in the euphotic zone of the Arctic Ocean. Phaeocystaceae, Micromonas sp., Dinophyceae and Syndinales constitute a high proportion of sequence reads, while sequence abundance of autotrophic Phaeocystaceae and mixotrophic Micromonas sp. was inversely correlated. Highest sequence abundances of Phaeocystaceae were observed in the warm Atlantic waters in Fram Strait, while Micromonas sp. dominated the abundant biosphere in the arctic halocline. Our results are from particular interest, because there are hypotheses that environmental conditions in Nansen Basin might become more similar to the current conditions in Fram Strait. In regard to this we propose that in response biodiversity and biomass of pico-eukaryotes in Nansen Basin could resemble those currently observed in the Fram Strait in the future. This would significantly alter biogeochemical cycles in that area, that constitutes a large part of the central Arctic Ocean.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

The stratified distribution of bacterial and archaeal communities has been detected in many sediment profiles from various natural environments. A better understanding of microbial composition and diversity pattern in coastal mangrove wetlands in relation to physicochemical and spatial-temporal influences could provide more insights into the ecological functions of microbes in coastal wetlands. In this study, seasonal variations of microbial communities within sediment profiles from two sediment types (mangrove forest and intertidal mudflats) at three sampling locations in coastal Mai Po wetland were characterized using MiSeq high throughput sequencing and 16S rRNA quantitative PCR methods. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance showed clear decreasing trends with increasing depth for all sites, seasonality and sediment types. There is a weak seasonal dynamic of bacterial and archaeal community abundance in both seasons. Seasonality imposed more influence on the beta diversity pattern of bacterial community than archaeal community. The five most abundant phyla within bacterial and archaeal community remain stable between two distinctive seasons. Sediment depth and seasonality are the most influential factors affecting bacterial community composition and diversity. The pH is the most influential factor on shaping the archaeal community. Stratified distribution of bacterial community including aerobic and anaerobic bacterial taxa is largely represented in the surface layers and the subsurface layers, respectively. For archaeal stratification<i>, Thaumarchaeota</i> Marine Group I is the dominant member in surface sediments while <i>Bathyarchaeota</i> and MBG-B dominate in subsurface sediments. Such stratified distribution patterns are irrespective of sediment types, sampling locations or seasonality, but significantly correlated to the sediment depth, which might be shaped by oxygen availability and the distribution of other terminal electron accepters along the depth profile.

The study was motivated by the paucity of knowledge in changes in microbial complexity in algal blooms and by the lack of empirical evidence of PCD from field and natural environments such as algal blooms. Despite the progress made, algal blooms remain poorly understood, specifically why a particular taxa proliferates to dominate the bloom remains a challenge and a call for species specific information has been made. Concomitant to documenting the changes in microbial diversity and environment conditions during an algal bloom, changes in gene expression in relation to PCD will also be assessed to provide a contextual understanding of PCD during a bloom event.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

However, the method suffers from cloning biases and limited throughput. We studied the composition and genetic diversity of picoeukaryotes off the subtropical western Pacific coast using cloning-independent and massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. The approach gave a high coverage of the community at genetic difference >=5% but still underestimated the total diversity at genetic difference <=2%. Picoeukaryotic assemblage in the eutrophic site was less diverse than that with low chlorophyll a biomass. Stramenopiles, dinoflagellates, ciliates and prasinophytes were the dominant groups, comprising approximately 29, 19, 11 and 11% of the picoeukaryotes respectively. A differential spatial distribution of high-level taxonomic groups and phylotype OTUs of picoeukaryotes was observed between samples. Our study represents the most comprehensive examination of marine picoeukaryotic diversity to date, using the 454 sequencing-by-synthesis technology for the first time.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	20336159	Composition and genetic diversity of picoeukaryotes in subtropical coastal waters as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.

MGYS00004127	Metagenetic analysis of copepod community in the tropical and subtropical Pacific	A large-scale biogeographic study of copepods is challenging in the tropical and subtropical Pacific due to inaccessibility, high species diversity and limitation by morphological identification. In this study, spatial patterns of epipelagic copepod community structure was revealed using 28S metagenetic method at 19 stations in Kuroshio, North Pacific subtropical gyre, eastern tropical Pacific and South Pacific subtropical gyre. The copepod communities were the most correlated to chlorophyll a, and community structure in subtropical gyres was different from those in Kuroshio and eastern tropical Pacific. The metagenetic analysis also could detect copepod diversity, and high copepod diversity was observed in oligotrophic North and South Pacific subtropical gyres with peak in North Pacific subtropical gyre. This is first metagenetic study of copepods covering wide-area and could serve as a basis of the understanding of diversity and biogeography of copepods in the tropical and subtropical Pacific.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine																																																
MGYS00004671	Gulf of Mexico Alkane Reactors Metagenome	Pyrosequencing of Gulf of Mexico sediments from anaerobic batch reactors with short-chain alkanes.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment	24376442	Geomicrobiological linkages between short-chain alkane consumption and sulfate reduction rates in seep sediments.	Marine hydrocarbon seeps are ecosystems that are rich in methane, and, in some cases, short-chain (C2-C5) and longer alkanes. C2-C4 alkanes such as ethane, propane, and butane can be significant components of seeping fluids. Some sulfate-reducing microbes oxidize short-chain alkanes anaerobically, and may play an important role in both the competition for sulfate and the local carbon budget. To better understand the anaerobic oxidation of short-chain n-alkanes coupled with sulfate-reduction, hydrocarbon-rich sediments from the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) were amended with artificial, sulfate-replete seawater and one of four n-alkanes (C1-C4) then incubated under strict anaerobic conditions. Measured rates of alkane oxidation and sulfate reduction closely follow stoichiometric predictions that assume the complete oxidation of alkanes to CO2 (though other sinks for alkane carbon likely exist). Changes in the Delta(13)C of all the alkanes in the reactors show enrichment over the course of the incubation, with the C3 and C4 incubations showing the greatest enrichment (4.4 and 4.5permille, respectively). The concurrent depletion in the Delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) implies a transfer of carbon from the alkane to the DIC pool (-3.5 and -6.7permille for C3 and C4 incubations, respectively). Microbial community analyses reveal that certain members of the class Deltaproteobacteria are selectively enriched as the incubations degrade C1-C4 alkanes. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that distinct phylotypes are enriched in the ethane reactors, while phylotypes in the propane and butane reactors align with previously identified C3-C4 alkane-oxidizing sulfate-reducers. These data further constrain the potential influence of alkane oxidation on sulfate reduction rates (SRRs) in cold hydrocarbon-rich sediments, provide insight into their contribution to local carbon cycling, and illustrate the extent to which short-chain alkanes can serve as electron donors and govern microbial community composition and density.

Thawing permafrost in the Canadian Arctic tundra leads to peat erosion and slumping in narrow and shallow runnel ponds that surround more commonly studied polygonal ponds. Here we compared the methane production between runnel and polygonal ponds using stable isotope ratios, 14C signatures, and investigated potential methanogenic communities through high-throughput sequencing archaeal 16S rRNA genes. We found that runnel ponds had significantly higher methane and carbon dioxide emissions, produced from a slightly larger fraction of old carbon, compared to polygonal ponds. The methane stable isotopic signature indicated production through acetoclastic methanogenesis, but gene signatures from acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Archaea were detected in both polygonal and runnel ponds. We conclude that runnel ponds represent a source of methane from potentially older C, and that they contain methanogenic communities able to use diverse sources of carbon, increasing the risk of augmented methane release under a warmer climate.

Here we provide evidence supporting connection between the presence of surfactant-associated bacteria in the near-surface layer of the ocean, slicks on the sea surface, and a distinctive feature in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of the sea surface. From DNA analyses of the in situ samples using pyrosequencing technology, we found the highest abundance of surfactant-associated bacterial taxa in the near surface layer below the slick. Our study suggests that production of surfactants by marine bacteria takes place in the organic-rich areas of the water column. Produced surfactants can then be transported to the sea surface and form slicks when certain physical conditions are met. This finding has potential applications in monitoring organic materials in the water column using remote sensing techniques. Identifying a connection between marine bacteria and production of natural surfactants may provide a better understanding of the global picture of biophysical processes at the boundary between the ocean and atmosphere, air-sea exchange of greenhouse gases, and production of climate-active marine aerosols.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic	26753514	Surfactant-associated bacteria in the near-surface layer of the ocean.

MGYS00004177	Spatial Variation of Coastal Bacterioplankton Community along a Nitrogen and Phosphorus Co-pollution Gradient	Anthropogenic discharges of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have caused widespread threats to coastal ecosystems. Bacterioplankton are known to play crucial roles in N/P cycling in marine environments, but little is known about how bacterioplankton community responds to N-P co-pollution. Here, we collected surface seawater samples along a transect in East China Sea. We applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing to investigate the spatial variation of bacterioplankton communities under a N-P co-pollution gradient. The bacterioplankton communities were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria, which were distinct from those of sediment bacterial assemblages at the same transect. The bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) did not vary consistently along the pollution gradient, but clustered into nearshore and offshore groups. The combined environmental factors and spatial distances contributed 30.4% and 12.2% to the variation of the BCC, respectivelys, with a high auto-correlated effect that constrained 25.8% variation. In addition, a series of sensitive bacterial OTUs were identified, whose abundances were significantly associated with the N and/or P levels. This study demonstrates that coastal N-P co-pollution dramatically alter the BCCs, while these changes could be characterized by a few sensitive bacterioplanktonic OTUs.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

This field study was conducted in the Caribbean Sea near Curacao (and saline ponds in Curacao as well) in April 2015 to examine phytoplankton community diversity.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	28073013	Newly discovered deep-branching marine plastid lineages are numerically rare but globally distributed.	Ocean surface warming is resulting in an expansion of stratified, low-nutrient environments, a process referred to as ocean desertification [1]. A challenge for assessing the impact of these changes is the lack of robust baseline information on the biological communities that carry out marine photosynthesis. Phytoplankton perform half of global biological CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, fuel marine food chains, and include diverse eukaryotic algae that have photosynthetic organelles (plastids) acquired through multiple evolutionary events [1-3]. While amassing data from ocean ecosystems for the Baselines Initiative (6,177 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and 9.4 million high-quality 16S V1-V2 amplicons) we identified two deep-branching plastid lineages based on 16S rRNA gene data. The two lineages have global distributions, but do not correspond to known phytoplankton. How the newly discovered phytoplankton lineages contribute to food chains and vertical carbon export to the deep sea remains unknown, but their prevalence in expanding, low nutrient surface waters suggests they will have a role in future oceans.																																													
MGYS00004502	Marine Bacteria 16S V4 Raw sequence reads	Analysis of Bacterioplankton Community Distribution Pattern in Bohai Bay	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal	32022464	Bacterioplankton community variation in Bohai Bay (China) is explained by joint effects of environmental and spatial factors.	Parsing the relative importance of environmental (recent disturbances) and spatial factors (historical processes) in determining community structure is a core issue in ecology. The Bohai Bay is a typical semi-enclosed bay located in the north of China, surrounding by the metropolitan area with anthropogenic disturbances made it a complex marine coastal system with pollution gradients, where the distributions and determinants of bacterioplankton communities remain unclear. In this study, we collected surface water samples from 19 sites across Bohai Bay at about 100 km scale to investigate the relative roles of local environments and regional spatial factors in shaping bacterioplankton community composition (BCC). The environmental parameters in the sampling region showed gradient change according to the geographic variation. Several abundant OTUs were significantly correlated with the pollution parameters in the studied area, and 16 OTUs of them showed distinct distribution pattern in different polluted regions with obvious geographic segmentation, which indicated the effects of pollution gradient and dispersal limitation on specific taxon. The BCCs did not show obviously clustering effect between different polluted regions, which indicated the complexity for explaining the BCC variation in the studied region. The partial Mantel test revealed stronger spatial effects on beta diversity than those of local environmental factors, which indicated that dispersal limitation accounted more for the beta diversity than environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, variation partitioning analysis (VPA) conducted by combining the environmental variables, linear trends, and principal coordinates of the variables from neighbor matrices (PCNM) showed that it was the joint effects of environmental and spatial factors contributed to the explained variation of BCC in the studied area. Considering the special human geography characteristics of Bohai Bay, the unmeasured biotic/abiotic factors, stochastic factors, and anthropogenic disturbances may be responsible for the unexplained variation of the BCC.

The dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), human pathogenic bacteria (HPB), and antibiotic-resistant HPB (ARHPB) from animal feedlot to nearby environment poses a potentially high risk to environmental ecology and public health. Here, a metagenomic analysis was employed to explore the dissemination of ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from a pig feedlot to surrounding stream and agricultural soils. In total, not detectable (ND)-1,628.4 myg/kg of antibiotic residues, 18 types of ARGs, 48 HPB species, and 216 ARB isolates were detected in all samples. Antibiotic residues from pig feedlot mainly migrated into stream sediments and greenhouse soil. The dominant ARGs and HPB species from pig feedlot spread into stream sediments (tetracycline resistance genes, Clostridium difficile, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), stream water (multidrug resistance (MDR) genes, Shigella flexneri, and Bordetella pertussis), and greenhouse soil (MDR genes, Bacillus anthracis, and Brucella melitensis).

MGYS00004553	Diamante Lake viral metagenome	Diamante Lake, located inside the Galan Volcano crater and placed at 4589m above sea level (coordinates: 26°00'51.04"S , 67°01'46.42"O), presents multiple extreme conditions that include: High UV radiation, salinity and arsenic, low oxygen pressure and a hydrothermal vent input. Red biofilm samples (mixed with sediments) from Diamante Lake were resuspended in PBS, cleared by centrifugation, and viral particles were purified using a CsCl gradient and ultracentrifugation. The total DNA of the purified viral fraction was then extracted using a Roche Viral DNA purification kit. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera library preparation kit from Promega and sequenced at 2x250bp using a Illumina MiSeq machine.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Non-marine Saline and Alkaline:Hypersaline

Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is an important nitrate reduction process in estuarine sediments. This study reports the first investigation of DNRA in the Yellow River Estuary located in Eastern Shandong, China. Saltwater intrusion could affect the physicochemical characteristics and change the microbial community structure of sediments. In this study, the activity, abundance and community diversity of DNRA bacteria were investigated during saltwater intrusion. The slurry incubation experiments combined with isotope-tracing techniques and qPCR results showed that DNRA rates and nrfA (the functional gene of DNRA bacteria) gene abundance varied over wide ranges across different sites. DNRA rates had a positive and significant correlation with sediment organic content and extractable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, while DNRA rates were weakly correlated with nrfA gene abundance. In comparison, the activities and abundance of DNRA bacteria did not change with a trend along salinity gradient. Pyrosequencing analysis of nrfA gene indicated that delta-proteobacteria was the most abundant at all sites, while epsilon-proteobacteria was hardly found. This study reveals that variability in the activities and community structure of DNRA bacteria is largely driven by changes in environmental factors and provides new insights into the characteristics of DNRA communities in estuarine ecosystems.

We also compared OTUs identified in biological triplicates.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	28441466	Biomonitoring of marine vertebrates in Monterey Bay using eDNA metabarcoding.	Molecular analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used to assess vertebrate biodiversity in aquatic systems, but limited work has applied eDNA technologies to marine waters. Further, there is limited understanding of the spatial distribution of vertebrate eDNA in marine waters. Here, we use an eDNA metabarcoding approach to target and amplify a hypervariable region of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene to characterize vertebrate communities at 10 oceanographic stations spanning 45 km within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). In this study, we collected three biological replicates of small volume water samples (1 L) at 2 depths at each of the 10 stations. We amplified fish mitochondrial DNA using a universal primer set. We obtained 5,644,299 high quality Illumina sequence reads from the environmental samples. The sequence reads were annotated to the lowest taxonomic assignment using a bioinformatics pipeline. The eDNA survey identified, to the lowest taxonomic rank, 7 families, 3 subfamilies, 10 genera, and 72 species of vertebrates at the study sites. These 92 distinct taxa come from 33 unique marine vertebrate families. We observed significantly different vertebrate community composition between sampling depths (0 m and 20/40 m deep) across all stations and significantly different communities at stations located on the continental shelf (&lt;200 m bottom depth) versus in the deeper waters of the canyons of Monterey Bay (&gt;200 m bottom depth). All but 1 family identified using eDNA metabarcoding is known to occur in MBNMS. The study informs the implementation of eDNA metabarcoding for vertebrate biomonitoring.

MGYS00004592	Marine bacterium Metagenome	Analyze the potential utilization of EPS	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	26571122	The Fate of Marine Bacterial Exopolysaccharide in Natural Marine Microbial Communities.	Most marine bacteria produce exopolysaccharides (EPS), and bacterial EPS represent an important source of dissolved organic carbon in marine ecosystems. It was proposed that bacterial EPS rich in uronic acid is resistant to mineralization by microbes and thus has a long residence time in global oceans. To confirm this hypothesis, bacterial EPS rich in galacturonic acid was isolated from Alteromonas sp. JL2810. The EPS was used to amend natural seawater to investigate the bioavailability of this EPS by native populations, in the presence and absence of ammonium and phosphate amendment. The data indicated that the bacterial EPS could not be completely consumed during the cultivation period and that the bioavailability of EPS was not only determined by its intrinsic properties, but was also determined by other factors such as the availability of inorganic nutrients. During the experiment, the humic-like component of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) was freshly produced. Bacterial community structure analysis indicated that the class Flavobacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes was the major contributor for the utilization of EPS. This report is the first to indicate that Flavobacteria are a major contributor to bacterial EPS degradation. The fraction of EPS that could not be completely utilized and the FDOM (e.g., humic acid-like substances) produced de novo may be refractory and may contribute to the carbon storage in the oceans.																																													
MGYS00004345	Microbial mats and sediments from Atacama	Atacama region in Chile is one of the most arid locations in the world. Extreme conditions in the area include: high UV irradiation, hypersalinity, drastic temperature changes, and desiccation. Hypersaline lakes can be found in this environment, and therein, bacterial communities thrive, forming different structures and colonizing varied niches. Given that the conditions in the lakes have important seasonal changes, including mainly temperature and dissecation, it is interesting to study the composition and evolution of these communities, and also its influence in the biogeochemical setting. In this dataset of bacterial diversity assessed by pyrosequencing V4 region of 16S rRNA gene, microbial mats and sediments from several lakes in Atacama region in Chile, including Coposa, Pucsa, Llamara, and Cejar, were analyzed.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Non-marine Saline and Alkaline:Hypersaline:Sediment

Up to 20% of prokaryotic organisms in the oceans are estimated to die every day due to viral infection and lysis. Viruses can therefore alter microbial diversity, community structure, and biogeochemical processes driven by these organisms. Cyanophages are viruses that infect and lyse cyanobacterial cells, adding bioavailable carbon and nutrients into the environment. Cyanobacteria are photosynthesizing bacteria, with some species capable of N<sub>2</sub> fixation, which are known to form large blooms as well as resistant resting cells known as akinetes. Here, we investigated cyanophage diversity and community structure plus cyanobacteria in dead zone sediments. We sampled surface sediments and sequenced DNA and RNA, along an oxygen gradient-representing oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic conditions-in one of the world's largest dead zones located in the Baltic Sea. Cyanophages were detected at all stations and, based on partial genome contigs, had a higher alpha diversity and different beta diversity in the hypoxic-anoxic sediments, suggesting that cyanobacteria in dead zone sediments and/or environmental conditions select for specific cyanophages. Some of these cyanophages can infect cyanobacteria with potential consequences for gene expression related to their photosystem and phosphate regulation. Top cyanobacterial genera detected in the anoxic sediment included <i>Dolichospermum</i>/<i>Anabaena</i>, <i>Synechococcus</i>, and <i>Cyanobium</i> RNA transcripts classified to cyanobacteria were associated with numerous pathways, including anaerobic carbon metabolism and N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Cyanobacterial blooms are known to fuel oxygen-depleted ecosystems with phosphorus (so-called internal loading), and our cyanophage data indicate the potential for viral lysis of cyanobacteria which might explain the high nutrient turnover in these environments.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Cyanophages are viruses that target cyanobacteria and directly control their abundance via viral lysis. Cyanobacteria are known to cause large blooms in water bodies, substantially contributing to oxygen depletion in bottom waters resulting in areas called dead zones. Our knowledge of cyanophages in dead zones is very scarce, and so far, no studies have assembled partial cyanophage genomes and investigated their associated cyanobacteria in these dark and anoxic sediments. Here, we present the first study using DNA and RNA sequencing to investigate <i>in situ</i> diversity of cyanophages and cyanobacteria in dead zones. Our study shows that dead zone sediments contain different cyanophages compared to oxic sediments and suggest that these viruses are able to affect cyanobacterial photosystem and phosphate regulation. Furthermore, cyanophage-controlled lysis of cyanobacteria might also increase the turnover of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen in these oxygen-free environments at the bottom of the sea.																																													
MGYS00004307	Impact of offshore oil drilling operations on the diversity of marine benthic Foraminifera  - Raw sequence reads	Environmental impacts from offshore oil and gas activities are currently partly determined by measuring changes in macro-infaunal diversity determined using microscopy.

Sediment samples were collected along distance gradients from two oil platform wellheads (WHs) off Taranaki (New Zealand) and their physico-chemical properties, foraminiferal environmental DNA/RNA, and macro-infaunal composition analysed.Our results suggest that foraminiferal metabarcoding may provide a more accurate assessment of the conditions of environmental communities at the time of sampling than current methods based on morphological examination.

Previous studies of microbial communities in deep-sea hydrothermal ferric deposits have demonstrated that members of Zetaproteobacteria play significant ecological roles in biogeochemical iron-cycling. However, the ecophysiological characteristics and interaction between other microbial members in the habitat still remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated microbial communities in a core sample obtained from shallow hydrothermal iron-oxyhydroxide deposits at Nagahama Bay of Satsuma Iwo-Jima, Japan. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed numerous helical stalk structures, suggesting the occurrence of iron-oxidizing bacteria. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated the co-occurrence of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria and iron-reducing bacteria such as the genera Deferrisoma and Desulfobulbus with strong correlations on the sequence abundance. CARD-FISH indicated that the numbers of Zetaproteobacteria were not always consistent to the frequency of stalk structures. In the stalk-abundant layers with relatively small numbers of Zetaproteobacteria cells, accumulation of polyphosphate was observed inside Zetaproteobacteria cells, whereas no polyphosphate grains were observed in the topmost layers with fewer stalks and abundant Zetaproteobacteria cells. These results suggest that Zetaproteobacteria store intracellular polyphosphates during active iron oxidation that contributes to the mineralogical growth and biogeochemical iron cycling.

Seasonal hypoxia in coastal systems drastically changes the availability of electron acceptors in bottom water, which alters the sedimentary reoxidation of reduced compounds. However, the effect of seasonal hypoxia on the chemolithoautotrophic community that catalyzes these reoxidation reactions is rarely studied. Here, we examine the changes in activity and structure of the sedimentary chemolithoautotrophic bacterial community of a seasonally hypoxic saline basin under oxic (spring) and hypoxic (summer) conditions. Combined 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analysis of phospholipid-derived fatty acids indicated a major temporal shift in community structure. Aerobic sulfur-oxidizing <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> (<i>Thiotrichales</i>) and <i>Epsilonproteobacteria</i> (<i>Campylobacterales</i>) were prevalent during spring, whereas <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> (<i>Desulfobacterales</i>) related to sulfate-reducing bacteria prevailed during summer hypoxia. Chemolithoautotrophy rates in the surface sediment were three times higher in spring than in summer. The depth distribution of chemolithoautotrophy was linked to the distinct sulfur oxidation mechanisms identified through microsensor profiling, i.e., canonical sulfur oxidation, electrogenic sulfur oxidation by cable bacteria, and sulfide oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction by <i>Beggiatoaceae</i> The metabolic diversity of the sulfur-oxidizing bacterial community suggests a complex niche partitioning within the sediment, probably driven by the availability of reduced sulfur compounds (H<sub>2</sub>S, S<sup>0</sup>, and S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and electron acceptors (O<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) regulated by seasonal hypoxia.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Chemolithoautotrophic microbes in the seafloor are dependent on electron acceptors, like oxygen and nitrate, that diffuse from the overlying water. Seasonal hypoxia, however, drastically changes the availability of these electron acceptors in the bottom water; hence, one expects a strong impact of seasonal hypoxia on sedimentary chemolithoautotrophy. A multidisciplinary investigation of the sediments in a seasonally hypoxic coastal basin confirms this hypothesis. Our data show that bacterial community structure and chemolithoautotrophic activity varied with the seasonal depletion of oxygen. Unexpectedly, the dark carbon fixation was also dependent on the dominant microbial pathway of sulfur oxidation occurring in the sediment (i.e., canonical sulfur oxidation, electrogenic sulfur oxidation by cable bacteria, and sulfide oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction by <i>Beggiatoaceae</i>). These results suggest that a complex niche partitioning within the sulfur-oxidizing bacterial community additionally affects the chemolithoautotrophic community of seasonally hypoxic sediments.																																													
MGYS00004446	Genetic potential for pentachlorophenol degradation at historically contaminated groundwater sites	Novel primers for pcpB  allowed us for the first time to investigate the genetic potential for degradation of the priority pollutant pentachlorophenol (PCP) in situ. We assessed whether pcpB is detectable at chlorophenol-polluted groundwater sediments at two sites, and if its abundance reflects differences in PCP concentration. We also sought correlations between the abundance and diversity of pcpB and sphingomonads that might indicate host specificity. pcpB was highly abundant, with copy numbers of up to 7% of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies, and its relative abundance was linked to spatial or temporal differences in groundwater PCP concentration at two historically polluted sites, indicating ecological relevance of the pathway in situ. pcpB abundance was associated with sphingomonad abundance, but independent of sphingomonad community composition. This provides the first culture-independent support for widespread horizontal transfer of PCP degradation potential among sphingomonads in chlorophenol-polluted groundwaters.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Groundwater:Contaminated

MGYS00004327	A diverse and metabolically active microbial community persists in deep subsurface clay borehole water	The Boom Clay layer in Belgium is investigated in the context of subsurface nuclear waste storage, making use of the underground laboratory HADES. The HADES facility offers a rather unique access to a subsurface microbial community, in an environment of which all geological and geochemical characteristics are being thoroughly studied. This study presents the first elaborate description of a subsurface clay microbial community, residing in Boom Clay borehole water. Using an integrated approach of microscopy, metagenomics, activity screening and cultivation, the presence and activity of this community is disclosed. Despite the low energy environment, the microscopy and molecular analyses show a surprisingly large bacterial diversity and richness, tending to correlate positively with the organic matter content of the environment. Among different samples, a core bacterial community comprising seven bacterial phyla is defined, including both aerobic and anaerobic genera with a range of metabolic preferences. In addition, when using the appropriate media, a considerably large fraction of this community is found cultivable, active in situ and matching the metagenomic data. In conclusion, this study shows the possibility of a microbial community of relative complexity to actively persist in subsurface Boom Clay.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

MGYS00004352	Cryoconite sediments Targeted Locus (Loci)	Biological processes on glacier surfaces affect the physical behaviour of glaciers and ice sheets and carbon and nutrient fluxes in the cryosphere. Changes in rates of biological processes are often associated with changes in diversity, yet there is little knowledge of the diversity of active microbes on glacier surfaces and its controls. We examined the microbial abundance, community structure, and the proportion of the active microbes at two contrasting surface sites located at the margin and in the interior of the Greenland ice sheet over the course of a melting season, using DNA and RNA co-extraction from the same samples, quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA and rDNA. Whereas the rDNA abundances were similar at both sites (108  109 copies g-1), the rRNA abundance was significantly higher in the interior (1010 copies g-1). Significant differences in diversity were found between the sites, with the DNA diversity significantly higher at the margin and the RNA diversity higher at the interior site. The bulk of the active communities at both sites comprised Cyanobacteria and Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria, suggesting a truncated food web structure dominated by few bacterial primary producers and decomposers. We suggest that the ice sheet margin contains a more diverse but less active assemblage of microbes while the interior harbours a less diverse but well-adapted active community. We propose that the process of community assembly at the surface of the GrIS can be understood as species sorting from a metacommunity of airborne microbes which land on the ice surface.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Ice:Glacier

Pyrosequencing of partial 16S rRNA genes did not indicate any significant changes in the relative abundance of any bacterial taxa with nano-TiO2 treatment, indicating that nano-TiO2 was toxic to a broad range of bacterial taxa and that recovery of the bacterial communities was not driven by changes in community composition.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

Communities of zooplankton, a critical portion of aquatic ecosystems, can be adversely affected by contamination resulting from human activities. Understanding the influence of environmental change on zooplankton communities under field-conditions is hindered by traditional labor-intensive approaches that are prone to taxonomic and enumeration mistakes. Here, metabarcoding of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) region of mitochondrial DNA was used to characterize the genetic diversity of zooplankton. The species composition of zooplankton communities determined by metabarcoding was consistent with the results based on the traditional morphological approach. The spatial distribution of common species (frequency of occurrence &gt;10 samples) by metabarcoding exhibited good agreement with morphological data. Furthermore, metabarcoding can clearly distinguish the composition of the zooplankton community between lake and river ecosystems. In general, rotifers were more abundant in riverine environments than lakes and reservoirs. Finally, the sequence read number of different taxonomic groups using metabarcoding was positively correlated with the zooplankton biomass inferred by density and body length of zooplankton. Overall, the utility of metabarcoding for taxonomic profiling of zooplankton communities was validated by the morphology-based method on a large ecological scale. Metabarcoding of COI could be a powerful and efficient biomonitoring tool to protect local aquatic ecosystems.

Knowledge on spatial scales of the distribution of deep-sea life is still sparse, but highly relevant to the understanding of dispersal, habitat ranges and ecological processes. We examined regional spatial distribution patterns of the benthic bacterial community and covarying environmental parameters such as water depth, biomass and energy availability at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site HAUSGARTEN (Eastern Fram Strait). Samples from 13 stations were retrieved from a bathymetric (1,284-3,535 m water depth, 54 km in length) and a latitudinal transect (~ 2,500 m water depth; 123 km in length). 454 massively parallel tag sequencing (MPTS) and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) were combined to describe both abundant and rare types shaping the bacterial community. This spatial sampling scheme allowed detection of up to 99% of the estimated richness on phylum and class levels. At the resolution of operational taxonomic units (97% sequence identity; OTU3%) only 36% of the Chao1 estimated richness was recovered, indicating a high diversity, mostly due to rare types (62% of all OTU3%). Accordingly, a high turnover of the bacterial community was also observed between any two sampling stations (average replacement of 79% of OTU3%), yet no direct correlation with spatial distance was observed within the region. Bacterial community composition and structure differed significantly with increasing water depth along the bathymetric transect. The relative sequence abundance of Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes decreased significantly with water depth, and that of Deferribacteres increased. Energy availability, estimated from phytodetrital pigment concentrations in the sediments, partly explained the variation in community structure. Overall, this study indicates a high proportion of unique bacterial types on relatively small spatial scales (tens of kilometers), and supports the sampling design of the LTER site HAUSGARTEN to study bacterial community shifts in this rapidly changing area of the world's oceans.

Anaerobic microbial hydrocarbon degradation is a major biogeochemical process at marine seeps. Here we studied the response of the microbial community to petroleum seepage simulated for 190 days in a sediment core from the Caspian Sea using a sediment-oil-flow-through (SOFT) system. Untreated (without simulated petroleum seepage) and SOFT sediment microbial communities shared 43% bacterial genus-level 16S rRNA-based operational taxonomic units (OTU<sub>0.945</sub>) but shared only 23% archaeal OTU<sub>0.945</sub>. The community differed significantly between sediment layers. The detection of fourfold higher deltaproteobacterial cell numbers in SOFT than in untreated sediment at depths characterized by highest sulfate reduction rates and strongest decrease of gaseous and mid-chain alkane concentrations indicated a specific response of hydrocarbon-degrading Deltaproteobacteria. Based on an increase in specific CARD-FISH cell numbers, we suggest the following groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria to be likely responsible for the observed decrease in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon concentration in SOFT sediments: clade SCA1 for propane and butane degradation, clade LCA2 for mid- to long-chain alkane degradation, clade Cyhx for cycloalkanes, pentane and hexane degradation, and relatives of <i>Desulfobacula</i> for toluene degradation. Highest numbers of archaea of the genus <i>Methanosarcina</i> were found in the methanogenic zone of the SOFT core where we detected preferential degradation of long-chain hydrocarbons. Sequencing of <i>masD</i>, a marker gene for alkane degradation encoding (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase, revealed a low diversity in SOFT sediment with two abundant species-level MasD OTU<sub>0.96</sub>.

MGYS00003750	Defining seasonal marine microbial community dynamics	In order to facilitate conservation of biological diversity we require comprehensive knowledge of the microbial ecology of an ecosystem. As the vast majority of microbes are not readily culturable, we must use molecular tools to investigate their diversity and function in marine ecosystem. However, it is still difficult to understand their role in ecological processes. Here we present a study to characterize changes in the diversity and metabolic activity of the heterotrophic bacterial community over an annual cycle in the Western English Channel. For this purpose, surface water samples were collected from the sampling station, L4, every week for a year. The respiration rate of the heterotrophic microbial community was determined from the decrease in dissolved oxygen content of the less than 0.8m size-fraction of the sea water. We are currently analyzing captured DNA using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing to determine the diversity and functional profile of the active bacteria in order to characterize annual changes in the active bacterial community. This dataset sits within the larger framework of the Western English Channel bacterial diversity time series (2003-2009) and the seasonal metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies associated with this site. We demonstrate that respiration rates are characterized by specific microbial diversity and function at different times of year, highlighting seasonal fluctuation in this ecosystem.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

MGYS00004459	MeHg Coal Ash	Mercury (Hg) associated with coal ash is an environmental concern, particularly if the release of coal ash to the environment is associated with the conversion of Hg to methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative form of Hg that is produced by anaerobic microorganisms. In this study, sediment slurry microcosm experiments were performed to understand how spilled coal ash might influence MeHg production in anaerobic sediments of an aquatic ecosystem. Two coal ash types were used: (1) a weathered coal ash; and (2) a freshly collected, unweathered fly ash that was relatively enriched in sulfate and Hg compared to the weathered ash. These ash samples were added to anaerobic sediment slurries constructed with a relatively pristine sediment (containing 0.03 mg kg-1 Hg) and a Hg-contaminated sediment (containing 0.29 mg kg-1 Hg). 16S amplicon sequencing of microbial communities in the slurries was done for each microcosm.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Sediment

The fungal composition, abundance and diversity of the mangrove sediments from the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries, Goa, using paired-end Illumina sequencing, hitherto unexplored by a metagenomic approach, indicated that though the types of fungal phyla were similar between the two sediments, the abundance of the species was significantly different between them (<i>p</i> value &lt; 0.005). Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were the two major phyla which were sub-divided into eighteen classes, families, orders, genera and species and one unassigned group in both the sediments. The top five classes observed were <i>Agaricomycetes</i>, <i>Sordariomycetes</i>, <i>Saccharomycetes</i>, <i>Dothideomycetes</i> and <i>Eurotiomycetes</i> from both the sediments. The diversity analysis based on the observed fungal species richness (Chao 1 for Mandovi were 614 and 714.7 while for Zuari were 665 and 771.2) revealed that Zuari sediment was taxonomically rich, indicating these to be potent candidates for bioremediation and a rich repository for biotechnologically important fungi.

To examine the biogeochemical response, high-throughput sequencing were applied to characterize bacterial population shifts.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Groundwater:Contaminated	29593667	Amplicon Sequencing Reveals Microbiological Signatures in Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Basins.	Water quality is an important determinant for the structural integrity of alloy cladded fuels and assemblies during long-term wet storage. Detailed characterization of a water filled storage basin for spent nuclear reactor fuel was performed following the formation and proliferation of an amorphous white flocculent. White precipitant was sampled throughout the storage basin for chemical and spectroscopic characterization, and environmental DNA was extracted for 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity. Accordingly, spectroscopic analyses indicated the precipitant to be primarily amorphous to crystalline aluminum (oxy) hydroxides with minor associated elemental components including Fe, Si, Ti, and U. High levels of organic carbon were co-localized with the precipitant relative to bulk dissolved organic concentrations. Bacterial densities were highly variable between sampling locations and with depth within the water filled storage basin; cell numbers ranged from 4 x 10<sup>3</sup>to 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL. Bacterial diversity that was physically associated with the aluminum (oxy) hydroxide complexes exceeded an estimated 4,000 OTUs/amplicon library (3% cutoff) and the majority of sequences were aligned to the families <i>Burkholderiaceae</i> (23%), <i>Nitrospiraceae</i> (23%), <i>Hyphomicrobiaceae</i> (17%), and <i>Comamonadaceae</i> (6%). We surmise that episodic changes in the physical and chemical properties of the basin contribute to the polymerization of aluminum (oxy) hydroxides, which in turn can chemisorb nutrients, carbon ligands and bacterial cells from the surrounding bulk aqueous phase. As such, these precipitants should establish favorable microhabitats for bacterial colonization and growth. Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries across a selection of natural and engineered aquatic ecosystems were performed and microbial community and taxonomic signatures unique to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage basin environment were revealed. These insights could spur the development of tractable bio-indicators that are specific of and diagnostic for water quality at discrete locations and finer scales of resolution, marking an important contribution for improved water quality and management of SNF storage facilities.	29453264	Bacterial Community Shift and Coexisting/Coexcluding Patterns Revealed by Network Analysis in a Uranium-Contaminated Site after Bioreduction Followed by Reoxidation.	A site in Oak Ridge, TN, USA, has sediments that contain &gt;3% iron oxides and is contaminated with uranium (U). The U(VI) was bioreduced to U(IV) and immobilized <i>in situ</i> through intermittent injections of ethanol. It then was allowed to reoxidize via the invasion of low-pH (3.6 to 4.0), high-nitrate (up to 200 mM) groundwater back into the reduced zone for 1,383 days. To examine the biogeochemical response, high-throughput sequencing and network analysis were applied to characterize bacterial population shifts, as well as cooccurrence and coexclusion patterns among microbial communities. A paired <i>t</i> test indicated no significant changes of Alfa-diversity for the bioactive wells. However, both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity confirmed a significant distinction in the overall composition of the bacterial communities between the bioreduced and the reoxidized sediments. The top 20 major genera accounted for &gt;70% of the cumulative contribution to the dissimilarity in the bacterial communities before and after the groundwater invasion. <i>Castellaniella</i> had the largest dissimilarity contribution (17.7%). For the bioactive wells, the abundance of the U(VI)-reducing genera <i>Geothrix</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Ferribacterium</i>, and <i>Geobacter</i> decreased significantly, whereas the denitrifying <i>Acidovorax</i> abundance increased significantly after groundwater invasion. Additionally, seven genera, i.e., <i>Castellaniella</i>, <i>Ignavibacterium</i>, <i>Simplicispira</i>, <i>Rhizomicrobium</i>, <i>Acidobacteria</i> Gp1, <i>Acidobacteria</i> Gp14, and <i>Acidobacteria</i> Gp23, were significant indicators of bioactive wells in the reoxidation stage. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that nitrate, manganese, and pH affected mostly the U(VI)-reducing genera and indicator genera. Cooccurrence patterns among microbial taxa suggested the presence of taxa sharing similar ecological niches or mutualism/commensalism/synergism interactions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> High-throughput sequencing technology in combination with a network analysis approach were used to investigate the stabilization of uranium and the corresponding dynamics of bacterial communities under field conditions with regard to the heterogeneity and complexity of the subsurface over the long term. The study also examined diversity and microbial community composition shift, the common genera, and indicator genera before and after long-term contaminated-groundwater invasion and the relationship between the target functional community structure and environmental factors. Additionally, deciphering cooccurrence and coexclusion patterns among microbial taxa and environmental parameters could help predict potential biotic interactions (cooperation/competition), shared physiologies, or habitat affinities, thus, improving our understanding of ecological niches occupied by certain specific species. These findings offer new insights into compositions of and associations among bacterial communities and serve as a foundation for future bioreduction implementation and monitoring efforts applied to uranium-contaminated sites.

These molecules are stable and resistant to variation in some physical and chemical factors (i.e. temperature, pH) and some common proteases. Besides, many studies have evidenced the process of bioaccumulation of MCs in different organisms, its adsorption to sediment particles and also its biodegradation by microorganisms from the environment. Previously, we evaluated the removal of MC from water by microorganism assemblages and biodegradation process was observed in the sediment as well as in the interstitial water.

We aimed to gain insight into the alkane degradation potential of microbial communities from chronically polluted sediments of a subantarctic coastal environment using a combination of metagenomic approaches. A total of 6178 sequences annotated as alkane-1-monooxygenases (EC 1.14.15.3) were retrieved from a shotgun metagenomic dataset that included two sites analyzed in triplicate. The majority of the sequences binned with AlkB described in Bacteroidetes (32 +/- 13 %) or Proteobacteria (29 +/- 7 %), although a large proportion remained unclassified at the phylum level. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based analyses showed small differences in AlkB distribution among samples that could be correlated with alkane concentrations, as well as with site-specific variations in pH and salinity. A number of low-abundance OTUs, mostly affiliated with Actinobacterial sequences, were found to be only present in the most contaminated samples. On the other hand, the molecular screening of a large-insert metagenomic library of intertidal sediments from one of the sampling sites identified two genomic fragments containing novel alkB gene sequences, as well as various contiguous genes related to lipid metabolism. Both genomic fragments were affiliated with the phylum Planctomycetes, and one could be further assigned to the genus Rhodopirellula due to the presence of a partial sequence of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. This work highlights the diversity of bacterial groups contributing to the alkane degradation potential and reveals patterns of functional diversity in relation with environmental stressors in a chronically polluted, high-latitude coastal environment. In addition, alkane biodegradation genes are described for the first time in members of Planctomycetes.

Despite high performance, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) still discharge significant amounts of organic material and nitrogen and even microbes into the receiving water bodies, altering physico-chemical conditions and microbial functions. In this study, we examined how nitrified wastewater affects the microbiology of boreal lake sediments. Microbial community compositions were assessed with next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and a more detailed view on nitrogen transformation processes was gained with qPCR targeting on functional genes (<i>nirS, nirK, nosZ</i><sub>I</sub>, <i>nosZ</i><sub>II</sub>, <i>amoA</i><sub>archaea</sub>, and <i>amoA</i><sub>bacteria</sub>). In both of the two studied lake sites, the microbial community composition differed significantly between control point and wastewater discharge point, and a gradual shift toward natural community composition was seen downstream following the wastewater gradient. SourceTracker analysis predicted that ~2% of sediment microbes were of WWTP-origin on the study site where wastewater was freely mixed with the lake water, while when wastewater was specially discharged to the sediment surface, ~6% of microbes originated from WWTP, but the wastewater-influenced area was more limited. In nitrogen transformation processes, the ratio between nitrifying archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) was affected by wastewater effluent, as the AOA abundance decreased from the control point (AOA:AOB 28:1 in Keuruu, 11:1 in Petaejaevesi) to the wastewater-influenced sampling points, where AOB dominated (AOA:AOB 1:2-1:15 in Keuruu, 1:3-1:19 in Petaejaevesi). The study showed that wastewater can affect sediment microbial community through importing nutrients and organic material and altering habitat characteristics, but also through bringing wastewater-originated microbes to the sediment, and may thus have significant impact on the freshwater biogeochemistry, especially in the nutrient-poor boreal ecosystems.

MGYS00004152	Archaeal diversity of Loki's Castle black smokers at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge	Hydrothermal vent systems harbor rich microbial communities ranging from aerobic  mesophiles to anaerobic hyperthermophiles. Among these, members of the archaeal domain  dominate the microbial communities in such extreme environments, partly because of their  temperature- and mechanically-resistant membrane lipids. In this study, we use geochemical  and molecular microbiological methods to investigate the abundance and diversity of archaea  in black smoker chimneys from the newly discovered Loki's Castle hydrothermal vent field  on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR) with vent fluid temperatures of 317°C and pH of  5.5. Archaeal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (GDGTs) with 0 to 4 cyclopentane  moieties were dominant in all sulfide samples and are most likely derived from both  (hyper)thermophilic Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, which are presumably involved in  sulfur and iron reduction, as well as methanogenesis. GDGTs with an additional covalent  bond between the isoprenoid hydrocarbon chains, so-called H-shaped GDGTs and also  containing 0 to 4 cyclopentane rings, were present with similar abundances. These lipids are  not often reported, but may be derived from sulfur-reducing members of the  Thermococcaceae. Crenarchaeol has been detected in samples derived from the chimney  exterior indicating the presence of Thaumarchaeota, involved in ammonia-oxidation (AOA)  at lower ambient temperatures. Our observations based on 16S rDNA-based taxonomy and  biomarker lipid analysis provide insight into microbial communities thriving within the  porous sulfide structures of an active deep-sea hydrothermal vent, where microbial cycling of  sulfur, hydrogen and methane predominantly by archaea may be the prevailing  biogeochemical processes.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Hydrothermal vents:Black smokers

The importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning across trophic levels, especially via predatory-prey interactions, is receiving increased recognition. However, this topic has rarely been explored for marine microbes, even though microbial biodiversity contributes significantly to marine ecosystem function and energy flows. Here we examined diversity and biomass of bacteria (prey) and nanoflagellates (predators), as well as their effects on trophic transfer efficiency in the East China Sea. Specifically, we investigated: (i) predator diversity effects on prey biomass and trophic transfer efficiency (using the biomass ratio of predator/prey as a proxy), (ii) prey diversity effects on predator biomass and trophic transfer efficiency, and (iii) the relationship between predator and prey diversity. We found higher prey diversity enhanced both diversity and biomass of predators, as well as trophic transfer efficiency, which may arise from more balanced diet and/or enhanced niche complementarity owing to higher prey diversity. By contrast, no clear effect was detected for predator diversity on prey biomass and transfer efficiency. Notably, we found prey diversity effects on predator-prey interactions; whereas, we found no significant diversity effect on biomass within the same trophic level. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multi-trophic biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in natural ecosystems.

Water samples were obtained with Niskin bottles attached to a CTD profiler that included sensors for conductivity, temperature, oxygen, fluorescence and turbidity. About 12L of seawater were sequentially filtered through a 20m nylon mesh, followed by a 3m and 0.2m polycarbonate filters of 47mm diameter. Only the picoplankton size-fraction (0.2-3 m) was used for sequencing. DNA was extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform protocol (Massana, et al. 1997). The V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the primers 515F-Y (5'-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5'-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT)  (Parada et al. 2016) and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq platform (2x250bp) at the Research and Testing Laboratory  (Lubbock, Texas, USA; http://www.researchandtesting.com).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	30663830	Higher contribution of globally rare bacterial taxa reflects environmental transitions across the surface ocean.	Microbial taxa range from being ubiquitous and abundant across space to extremely rare and endemic, depending on their ecophysiology and on different processes acting locally or regionally. However, little is known about how cosmopolitan or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA-defined Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally-distributed surface ocean stations. We grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape ("normal-like"- abundant and ubiquitous; "logistic"- globally rare, present in few sites; and "bimodal"- abundant only in certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated by a few cosmopolitan "normal-like" OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards assemblages dominated by "logistic" taxa in specific areas with productivity and temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations. When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer "normal-like" shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.

Seafloor basalts are widely distributed and host diverse prokaryotic communities, but no data exist concerning the metabolic rates of the resident microbial communities. We present here potential extracellular enzyme activities of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) measured on basalt samples from different locations on Loihi Seamount, HI, coupled with analysis of prokaryotic biomass and pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The community maximum potential enzyme activity (Vmax) of LAP ranged from 0.47 to 0.90 nmol (g rock)(-1) h(-1); the Vmax for AP was 28 to 60 nmol (g rock)(-1) h(-1). The Km of LAP ranged from 26 to 33 myM, while the Km for AP was 2 to 7 myM. Bacterial communities on Loihi basalts were comprised primarily of Alpha-, Delta-, andGammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. The putative ability to produce LAP is evenly distributed across the most commonly detected bacterial orders, but the ability to produce AP is likely dominated by bacteria in the orders Xanthomonadales, Flavobacteriales, and Planctomycetales. The enzyme activities on Loihi basalts were compared to those of other marine environments that have been studied and were found to be similar in magnitude to those from continental shelf sediments and orders of magnitude higher than any measured in the water column, demonstrating that the potential for exposed basalts to transform organic matter is substantial. We propose that microbial communities on basaltic rock play a significant, quantifiable role in benthic biogeochemical processes.

MGYS00004181	16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and clone library revealed highly diverse microbial communities in natural marine biofilms	Microbial communities in biofilms have been suggested to mediate a wide spectrum of ecological functions. However, the underlying mechanism of most of the mediations is still unresolved mainly because of the uncertainty in characterizing members in the communities using existing 16S rRNA gene-based molecular methods. In this study, a newly developed method – barcoded 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing – was employed to provide a detailed characterization of the bacterial communities in intertidal and subtidal marine biofilms developed in two seasons. This method has high sensitivity to detect low-abundance taxa and is able to generate a large amount of highly reliable data in a very short period of time. Our results revealed highly diverse biofilm bacterial communities varied with season and tidal level. Over 6,000 OTUs with species estimates of up to 15,000 were recovered in a biofilm sample, which is by far the highest record in sub-tropical marine biofilms and is much greater than biofilms developed in certain natural habitats. Nineteen phyla were found in the biofilm samples, for which Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum dominating the intertidal and subtidal biofilms, respectively. Apart from these two phyla, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were found to be the major groups recovered in both intertidal and subtidal biofilms, yet their relative abundance varied among samples. Full-length 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed for the 4 biofilm samples and showed similar results with pyrosequencing. The relationship of bacterial community and settlement of larvae of a marine invertebrate is discussed.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

Tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) are common groundwater contaminants that also impact tidal flats, especially near urban and industrial areas. However, very little is known about dechlorinating microbial communities in tidal flats. Titanium pyrosequencing, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and dechlorinator-targeted quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) characterized reductive dechlorinating activities and populations in tidal flat sediments collected from South Korea's central west coast near Kangwha. In microcosms established with surface sediments, PCE dechlorination to TCE began within 10 days and 100% of the initial amount of PCE was converted to TCE after 37 days. cis-1,2-Dichloroethene (cis-DCE) was observed as dechlorination end product in microcosms containing sediments collected from deeper zones (i.e., 35-40 cm below ground surface). Pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and 16S rRNA gene-targeted qPCR results revealed Desulfuromonas michiganensis-like populations predominanted in both TCE and cis-DCE producing microcosms. Other abundant groups included Desulfuromonas thiophila and Pelobacter acidigallici-like populations in the surface sediment microcosms, and Desulfovibrio dechloracetivorans and Fusibacter paucivorans-like populations in the deeper sediment microcosms. Dehalococcoides spp. populations were not detected in these sediments before and after incubation with PCE. The results suggest that tidal flats harbor novel, salt-tolerant dechlorinating populations and that titanium pyrosequencing provides more detailed insight into community structure dynamics of the dechlorinating microcosms than conventional 16S rRNA gene sequencing or fingerprinting methods.

MGYS00005141	Temporal sampling of marine metagenomes from Station ALOHA and BATS		root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic	31840364	Ecogenomics of the SAR11 clade.	Members of the SAR11 clade, despite their high abundance, are often poorly represented by metagenome-assembled genomes. This fact has hampered our knowledge about their ecology and genetic diversity. Here we examined 175 SAR11 genomes, including 47 new single-amplified genomes. The presence of the first genomes associated with subclade IV suggests that, in the same way as subclade V, they might be outside the proposed Pelagibacterales order. An expanded phylogenomic classification together with patterns of metagenomic recruitment at a global scale have allowed us to define new ecogenomic units of classification (genomospecies), appearing at different, and sometimes restricted, metagenomic data sets. We detected greater microdiversity across the water column at a single location than in samples collected from similar depth across the global ocean, suggesting little influence of biogeography. In addition, pangenome analysis revealed that the flexible genome was essential to shape genomospecies distribution. In one genomospecies preferentially found within the Mediterranean, a set of genes involved in phosphonate utilization was detected. While another, with a more cosmopolitan distribution, was unique in having an aerobic purine degradation pathway. Together, these results provide a glimpse of the enormous genomic diversity within this clade at a finer resolution than the currently defined clades.	30179232	Marine microbial metagenomes sampled across space and time.	Recent advances in understanding the ecology of marine systems have been greatly facilitated by the growing availability of metagenomic data, which provide information on the identity, diversity and functional potential of the microbial community in a particular place and time. Here we present a dataset comprising over 5 terabases of metagenomic data from 610 samples spanning diverse regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. One set of metagenomes, collected on GEOTRACES cruises, captures large geographic transects at multiple depths per station. The second set represents two years of time-series data, collected at roughly monthly intervals from 3 depths at two long-term ocean sampling sites, Station ALOHA and BATS. These metagenomes contain genomic information from a diverse range of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses. The data's utility is strengthened by the availability of extensive physical, chemical, and biological measurements associated with each sample. We expect that these metagenomes will facilitate a wide range of comparative studies that seek to illuminate new aspects of marine microbial ecosystems.

Two of the sites are below sea level and two are above sea level. The data set includes samples before and after a tidal re-instatement project. Greenhouse gas fluxes, water levels, and salinity were also collected to identify the potential of blue carbon in coastal wetlands.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment	30867475	Blue carbon potential of coastal wetland restoration varies with inundation and rainfall.	There is a growing interest in how the management of 'blue carbon' sequestered by coastal wetlands can influence global greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. A promising intervention is through restoring tidal exchange to impounded coastal wetlands for reduced methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions. We monitored an impounded wetland's GHG flux (CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) prior to and following tidal reinstatement. We found that biogeochemical responses varied across an elevation gradient. The low elevation zone experienced a greater increase in water level and an associated greater marine transition in the sediment microbial community (16 S rRNA) than the high elevation zone. The low elevation zone's GHG emissions had a reduced sustained global warming potential of 264 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub>-e over 100 years, and it increased to 351 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> with the removal of extreme rain events. However, emission benefits were achieved through a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, not CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Overall, the wetland shifted from a prior CH<sub>4</sub> sink (-0.07 to -1.74 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) to a variable sink or source depending on the elevation site and rainfall. This highlights the need to consider a wetland's initial GHG emissions, elevation and future rainfall trends when assessing the efficacy of tidal reinstatement for GHG emission control.																																													
MGYS00005300	Microbial biogeography of 925 geothermal springs in New Zealand	Geothermal springs are model ecosystems to investigate microbial biogeography as they represent discrete, relatively homogenous habitats, are distributed across multiple geographical scales, span broad geochemical gradients, and have reduced metazoan interactions. Here, we report the largest known consolidated study of geothermal ecosystems to determine factors that influence biogeographical patterns. We measured bacterial and archaeal community composition, 46 physicochemical parameters, and metadata from 925 geothermal springs across New Zealand (13.9100.6 C and pH <19.7). We determined that diversity is primarily influenced by pH at temperatures <70 C; with temperature only having a significant effect for values >70 C. Further, community dissimilarity increases with geographic distance, with niche selection driving assembly at a localised scale. Surprisingly, two genera (Venenivibrio and Acidithiobacillus) dominated in both average relative abundance (11.2% and 11.1%, respectively) and prevalence (74.2% and 62.9%, respectively). These findings provide an unprecedented insight into ecological behaviour in geothermal springs, and a foundation to improve the characterisation of microbial biogeographical processes.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Thermal springs	30038374	Microbial biogeography of 925 geothermal springs in New Zealand.

MGYS00004624	Microbial ecology of AOB community in sediment from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay	Microbial ecology of AOB community	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment	29456526	Ammonia-Oxidizing Archaea and Bacteria Differentially Contribute to Ammonia Oxidation in Sediments from Adjacent Waters of Rushan Bay, China.	Ammonia oxidation plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) are the key contributors to ammonia oxidation, and their relative contribution to this process is one of the most important issues related to the nitrogen cycle in the ocean. In this study, the differential contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation in surface sediments from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay were studied based on the ammonia monooxygenase (<i>amoA</i>) gene. Molecular biology techniques were used to analyze ammonia oxidizers' community characteristics, and potential nitrification incubation was applied to understand the ammonia oxidizers' community activity. The objective was to determine the community structure and activity of AOA and AOB in surface sediments from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay and to discuss the different contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation during summer and winter seasons in the studied area. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the diversity of AOA was higher than that of AOB. The majority of AOA and AOB clustered into <i>Nitrosopumilus</i> and <i>Nitrosospira</i>, respectively, indicating that the <i>Nitrosopumilus</i> group and <i>Nitrosospira</i> groups may be more adaptable in studied sediments. The AOA community was closely correlated to temperature, salinity and ammonium concentration, whereas the AOB community showed a stronger correlation with temperature, chlorophyll-<i>a</i> content (chla) and nitrite concentration. qPCR results showed that both the abundance and the transcript abundance of AOA was consistently greater than that of AOB. AOA and AOB differentially contributed to ammonia oxidation in different seasons. AOB occupied the dominant position in mediating ammonia oxidation during summer, while AOA might play a dominant role in ammonia oxidation during winter.

The ability to compare the composition and metabolic potential of microbial communities inhabiting the subsurface sediment in geographically distinct locations is one of the keys to understanding the evolution and function of the subsurface biosphere. Prospective areas for study of the subsurface biosphere are the sites of hydrocarbon discharges on the bottom of the Lake Baikal rift, where ascending fluxes of gas-saturated fluids and oil from deep layers of bottom sediments seep into near-surface sediment. The samples of surface sediments collected in the area of the Posolskaya Bank methane seep were cultured for 17 months under thermobaric conditions (80C, 5 MPa) with the addition of complementary organic substrate, and a different composition for the gas phase. After incubation, the presence of intact cells of microorganisms, organic matter transformation and the formation of oil biomarkers was confirmed in the samples, with the addition of Baikal diatom alga Synedra acus detritus, and gas mixture CH4:H2:CO2. Taxonomic assignment of the 16S rRNA sequence data indicates that the predominant sequences in the enrichment were Sphingomonas (55.3%), Solirubrobacter (27.5%) and Arthrobacter (16.6%). At the same time, in heat-killed sediment and in sediment without any additional substrates, which were cultivated in a CH4 atmosphere, no geochemical changes were detected, nor the presence of intact cells and 16S rRNA sequences of Bacteria and Archaea. This data may suggest that the decomposition of organic matter under culturing conditions could be performed by microorganisms from low-temperature sediment layers. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is migration of the representatives of the deep thermophilic community through fault zones in the near surface sediment layers, together with gas-bearing fluids.

Recent advances in the bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated environments have focused on the development of approaches to stimulate the activities of indigenous bacterial communities. In this study, extracellular organic matter (EOM) from Micrococcus luteus was used to enhance the biphenyl-degrading capability of potentially functional microorganisms. The obtained results suggest that EOM significantly enhanced the biphenyl (BP)-degradation capability. Under a concentration of 3,500 mg/L BP, BP-degradation efficiency reached 60.8 % at a dosage of 10 % EOM (v/v), whereas the degradation efficiencies of control group (with inactivated EOM addition) and blank group (with lactate minimal medium) were only 21.5 and 6.2 %, respectively. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles demonstrated that EOM played a key role in shifts in the composition and diversity of bacterial community. The Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the genera of Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas closely related to BP/PCB-degradation were greatly abundant after EOM addition. Together with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DGGE analysis, the link between the enhanced BP-degrading capability and the stimulation and resuscitation function of EOM in uncultured bacteria belonging to phylum Actinobacteria was tentatively established. These results suggest that EOM from M. luteus as an additive holds great potential for the efficient and cost-effective bioremediation of PCB-contaminated environment.

Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which can preserve the signatures of present and past infections.

Pseudo-nitzschia blooms often occur in coastal and open ocean environments, sometimes leading to the production of the neurotoxin domoic acid that can cause severe negative impacts to higher trophic levels. Increasing evidence suggests a close relationship between phytoplankton bloom and bacterial assemblages, however, the microbial composition and succession during a bloom process is unknown. Here, we investigate the bacterial assemblages before, during and after toxic and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms to determine the patterns of bacterial succession in a natural bloom setting. Opportunistic sampling of bacterial community profiles were determined weekly at Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf by 454 pyrosequencing and analyzed together with domoic acid levels, phytoplankton community and biomass, nutrients and temperature. We asked if the bacterial communities are similar between bloom and non-bloom events and if domoic acid or the presence of toxic algal species acts as a driving force that can significantly structure phytoplankton-associated bacterial communities. We found that bacterial diversity generally increases when Pseudo-nitzschia numbers decline. Furthermore, bacterial diversity is higher when the low-DA producing P. fraudulenta dominates the algal bloom while bacterial diversity is lower when high-DA producing P. australis dominates the algal bloom, suggesting that the presence of algal toxin can structure bacterial community. We also found bloom-related succession patterns among associated bacterial groups; Gamma-proteobacteria, were dominant during low toxic P. fraudulenta blooms comprising mostly of Vibrio spp., which increased in relative abundance (6-65%) as the bloom progresses. On the other hand, Firmicutes bacteria comprising mostly of Planococcus spp. (12-86%) dominate during high toxic P. australis blooms, with the bacterial assemblage showing the same bloom-related successional patterns in three independent bloom events. Other environmental variables such as nitrate and phosphate and temperature appear to influence some low abundant bacterial groups as well. Our results suggest that phytoplankton-associated bacterial communities are strongly affected not just by phytoplankton bloom in general, but also by the type of algal species that dominates in the natural bloom.

MGYS00004322	Evidence  of  bacterioplankton community adaption in responses to  long-term mariculture disturbance	Mariculture activity acts as a disturbance to bacterioplankton community because it results in coastal eutrophication known to alter the bacterial composition. However, to what extent that such disturbance affects turnover of bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) and network interactions among bacterial assemblages are largely unknown. To this end, using 454  pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene, we evaluated the effects of mariculture disturbance on the temporal dynamics of BCC in Xiangshan Bay, the East China Sea. Clearly seasonal succession and sites (fish farm and control sites) separation of BCC were observed, which follow the time-decay for similarity  relationship.  Sampling  time  and mariculture  disturbance  respectively contributed 19.3% (P = 0.001) and 4.3% (P = 0.008) variations of the BCC. However, seasonal dynamics of bacterial alpha-diversity had no obvious trend, but were tightly associated with the relative abundances of potential bacterial predators. The temporal succession of the  BCC was significantly correlated with seawater temperature, chemical oxygen demand, N/P  ratio, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll a. We observed over the three seasons the  same change pattern for a few dominant bacterial families under mariculture disturbance. Additionally, mariculture disturbance considerably decelerated the temporal turnover rate, but  intensified the network interactions of bacterial community. These results demonstrate that BCC is sensitive to mariculture disturbance in this study region, while the consistency with which sensitive bacterial assemblages could characterize such disturbance. Low temporal turnover rate and complex network interactions, thus enabling bacterial communities were adaptive to long-term mariculture disturbance.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal

MGYS00003990	Marine subseafloor sediment Targeted Locus (Loci)	We examine the relationship between subseafloor microbial diversity and paleoceanographic conditions in samples from three sediment cores from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. All three cores record dramatic changes in oceanographic/limnic conditions resulting from oscillation between oligotrophic and euxinic condition, yet they also differ remarkably between sites. Our motivation for this study is based on the premise that paleoenvironmental conditions in the overlying water column are intimately linked to the composition of aquatic microbial communities and thus the inoculum for subseafloor communities. Our study will address the long-standing question to what degree the composition of subseafloor microbial communities is linked to paleoenvironmental conditions at time of deposition. The sample set at both Mediterranean sites is composed of carbonate-rich, organic-lean sediments and interspersed so-called sapropels, that is, organic-rich black layers that were deposited during climates that were probably warmer and more humid than today, when the Mediterranean was euxinic. The samples from the discovery basin are influenced by a highly saline brine and thus may select for halophilic sedimentary microbes. The Black Sea sample set is composed of organic-lean coccolith ooze deposited during the recent few thousand years, an organic-rich sapropel deposited during the early Holocene and below of sediment deposited during the late glacial/early Holocene when the Black Sea was still a freshwater lake. We examine both archaeal and bacterial diversity with a 454-based tag sequencing survey. We can address questions relating to the paleoenvironmental history at each site as well as to the relationship of microbial communities in sediments deposited during euxinic conditions at three sites along a salinity gradient remote to each other, in two different ocean basins. The sample set will be accompanied by an in-depth biogeochemical characterization of its sedimentary habitat. Sediment sampling and characterization are performed and mutually integrated on the same cruise (RV Meteor, M84-1, February 9-22, 2011) by the proponents of this proposal.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment																																																
MGYS00004660	Hydrocarbon biodegradation potential affected by geographical location, tempearture, and nutrient	Surface water samples from three different geographical locations were incubated with oil at a systematic set of temperature and nutrient conditions.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Oil-contaminated	31126938	Hydrocarbon-Degrading Microbial Communities Are Site Specific, and Their Activity Is Limited by Synergies in Temperature and Nutrient Availability in Surface Ocean Waters.	The objective of this study was to quantify the potential for hydrocarbon biodegradation in surface waters of three sites, representing geographic regions of major oil exploration (Beaufort Sea in the Arctic, northern Gulf of Mexico [GOM], and southern GOM), in a systematic experimental design that incorporated gradients in temperature and the availability of major nutrients. Surface seawater was amended in microcosms with Macondo surrogate oil to simulate an oil slick, and microcosms were incubated, with or without nutrient amendment, at temperatures ranging from 4 to 38<sup></sup>C. Using respiration rate as a proxy, distinct temperature responses were observed in surface seawater microcosms based on geographic origin; biodegradation was nearly always more rapid in the Arctic site samples than in the GOM samples. Nutrient amendment enhanced respiration rates by a factor of approximately 6, stimulated microbial growth, and generally elevated the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities within the optimal temperature range for activity at each site, while diversity remained the same or was lower at temperatures deviating from optimal conditions. Taken together, our results advance the understanding of how bacterioplankton communities from different geographic regions respond to oil perturbation. A pulsed disturbance of oil is proposed to favor copiotrophic r-strategists that are adapted to pointed seasonal inputs of phytoplankton carbon, displaying carbon and nutrient limitations, rather than oil exposure history. Further understanding of the ecological mechanisms underpinning the complex environmental controls of hydrocarbon degradation is required for improvement of predictive models of the fate and transport of spilled oil in marine environments.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The risk of an oil spill accident in pristine regions of the world's oceans is increasing due to the development and transport of crude oil resources, especially in the Arctic region, as a result of the opening of ice-free transportation routes, and there is currently no consensus regarding the complex interplay among the environmental controls of petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation for predictive modeling. We examined the hydrocarbon biodegradation potential of bacterioplankton from three representative geographic regions of oil exploration. Our results showed that rates of aerobic respiration coupled to hydrocarbon degradation in surface ocean waters are controlled to a large extent by effects of temperature and nutrient limitation; hydrocarbon exposure history did not appear to have a major impact. Further, the relationship between temperature and biodegradation rates is linked to microbial community structure, which is specific to the geographic origin.

Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which can preserve the signatures of present and past infections.																																													
MGYS00004238	Microbial processes in iron-rich sediments of Lake Towuti, Indonesia: Disentangling the methane and iron cycles	Lake Towuti is a ferruginous basin with anoxic conditions below 130 m water depth. Due to these special settings, the lake is ideal to study early diagenesis in iron-rich sediments such as those that generated ancient iron formations during the Archean and Proterozoic. We investigated microbial populations present in the sediments, their role in iron cycle and any cryptic link to other elements. For this purpose, we worked on samples from short cores that were retrieved from Lake Towuti by our scientific team from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (Potsdam, Germany) and the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). This project was supported by the ICDP priority program of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through grants to Jens Kallmeyer (KA 2293/8-1) and Aurèle Vuillemin (VU 94/1-1); the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. P2GEP2_148621 to Aurèle Vuillemin); the German Research Centre for Geosciences through an expedition grant to Jens Kallmeyer and Dirk Wagner; and an Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery grant (no. 0487) to Sean A. Crowe.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lentic:Sediment	29968357	Metabolic potential of microbial communities from ferruginous sediments.	Ferruginous (Fe-rich, SO<sub>4</sub> -poor) conditions are generally restricted to freshwater sediments on Earth today, but were likely widespread during the Archean and Proterozoic Eons. Lake Towuti, Indonesia, is a large ferruginous lake that likely hosts geochemical processes analogous to those that operated in the ferruginous Archean ocean. The metabolic potential of microbial communities and related biogeochemical cycling under such conditions remain largely unknown. We combined geochemical measurements (pore water chemistry, sulfate reduction rates) with metagenomics to link metabolic potential with geochemical processes in the upper 50 cm of sediment. Microbial diversity and quantities of genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (dsrAB) and methanogenesis (mcrA) decrease with increasing depth, as do rates of potential sulfate reduction. The presence of taxa affiliated with known iron- and sulfate-reducers implies potential use of ferric iron and sulfate as electron acceptors. Pore-water concentrations of acetate imply active production through fermentation. Fermentation likely provides substrates for respiration with iron and sulfate as electron donors and for methanogens that were detected throughout the core. The presence of ANME-1 16S and mcrA genes suggests potential for anaerobic methane oxidation. Overall our data suggest that microbial community metabolism in anoxic ferruginous sediments support coupled Fe, S and C biogeochemical cycling.	28798742	Preservation and Significance of Extracellular DNA in Ferruginous Sediments from Lake Towuti, Indonesia.	Extracellular DNA is ubiquitous in soil and sediment and constitutes a dominant fraction of environmental DNA in aquatic systems. In theory, extracellular DNA is composed of genomic elements persisting at different degrees of preservation produced by processes occurring on land, in the water column and sediment. Extracellular DNA can be taken up as a nutrient source, excreted or degraded by microorganisms, or adsorbed onto mineral matrices, thus potentially preserving information from past environments. To test whether extracellular DNA records lacustrine conditions, we sequentially extracted extracellular and intracellular DNA from anoxic sediments of ferruginous Lake Towuti, Indonesia. We applied 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing on both fractions to discriminate exogenous from endogenous sources of extracellular DNA in the sediment. Environmental sequences exclusively found as extracellular DNA in the sediment originated from multiple sources. For instance, <i>Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia</i>, and <i>Acidobacteria</i> derived from soils in the catchment. Limited primary productivity in the water column resulted in few sequences of <i>Cyanobacteria</i> in the oxic photic zone, whereas stratification of the water body mainly led to secondary production by aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs. <i>Chloroflexi</i> and <i>Planctomycetes</i>, the main degraders of sinking organic matter and planktonic sequences at the water-sediment interface, were preferentially preserved during the initial phase of burial. To trace endogenous sources of extracellular DNA, we used relative abundances of taxa in the intracellular DNA to define which microbial populations grow, decline or persist at low density with sediment depth. Cell lysis became an important additional source of extracellular DNA, gradually covering previous genetic assemblages as other microbial genera became more abundant with depth. The use of extracellular DNA as nutrient by active microorganisms led to selective removal of sequences with lowest GC contents. We conclude that extracellular DNA preserved in shallow lacustrine sediments reflects the initial environmental context, but is gradually modified and thereby shifts from its stratigraphic context. Discrimination of exogenous and endogenous sources of extracellular DNA allows simultaneously addressing in-lake and post-depositional processes. In deeper sediments, the accumulation of resting stages and sequences from cell lysis would require stringent extraction and specific primers if ancient DNA is targeted.

In this study, we used 454-pyrosequencing to report the highly diverse diazotroph communities in the Kuroshio and its adjacent waters along a transect across the Tokara Strait, Japan. Terrestrial input from the islands resulted in a highly heterogeneous diazotroph community within a relatively small geographic region, which was presumably caused by the remarkably different responses of UCYN-A2, UCYN-C and Trichodesmium to the steep environmental gradient. On the other hand, most major cyanobacterial OTUs found in this study were also detected in an unpublished dataset from the upstream Kuroshio, which suggests transportation of diazotrophs by the Kuroshio in large geographic scale. A significant amount of UCYN-C was found in the Kuroshio and offshore stations, suggesting the importance of this potentially overlooked group in the western North Pacific Ocean (WNPO). Moreover, a novel sublineage of UCYN-B was defined, which was predominant in an oligotrophic water sample; and it was also found to be widely distributed in oceanic waters. In addition, the apparent increase in relative abundance of UCYN-A2 from offshore to near-shore water provides evidence for the earlier and under-debating view that UCYN-A2 prefers coastal conditions. Our report provides new knowledge for understanding the phylogeny and ecology of unicellular cyanobacterial diazotrophs in WNPO.																																													
MGYS00004286	microbial communities in long-term e-waste contaminated river sediments	The release of toxic organic pollutants and heavy metals by primitive electronic waste (e-waste) processing to waterways has raised significant concerns, but little is known about their potential ecological effects on aquatic biota especially microorganisms. We characterized the microbial community composition and diversity in sediments sampled along two rivers consistently polluted by e-waste, and examined how community functions respond to the complex combined pollution. High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing showed that Proteobacteria (particularly Deltaproteobacteria) dominated the sediment microbial assemblages followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. PICRUSt metagenome inference provided an initial insight into the metabolic potentials of these e-waste affected communities, with genes encoding key enzymes (including dioxygenase, dehydrogenase, aldolase, decarboxylase, hydroxylase and hydrolase) in organic pollutants-degradation pathways largely harbored by some of the dominant genera (such as Sulfuricurvum, Thiobacillus and Burkholderia) detected in situ. Statistical analyses revealed that toxic organic compounds contributed more to the observed variations in sediment microbial community structure and function (24.68% and 8.89%, respectively) than heavy metals (12.18% and 4.68%), and BaP, available lead and EC were the key contributors. Given the ecological significance of microbes in sediments, long-term e-waste pollution has the potential to alter nutrient cycling and contribute to functional perturbation of freshwater systems.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lotic:Sediment

KEOPS2 data showed that natural iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean at the scale of hundreds of thousands km2 produced a mosaic of blooms, and that the biological and biogeochemical response to fertilization was diverse. The objective of this study was to explore the microbial eukaryotic community structure using 18S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing during the onset of spring phytoplankton blooms in the context of natural Fe fertilization of the Southern Ocean. The hypothesis tested was that the protistan communities would differ between the Fe-fertilised blooms and the HNLC waters and also between the blooms. The use of pyrotags provided a unifying approach for assessing the breadth of protistan communities including the groups that are quasi impossible to characterize using traditional approaches of microscopy and culture (e.g MAST, MALV, Fungi..).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

The effect of plant invasion on the microorganisms of soil sediments is very important for estuary ecology. The community structures of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) as a function of Spartina alterniflora invasion in Phragmites australis-vegetated sediments of the Dongtan wetland in the Yangtze River estuary, China, were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of the methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) and dissimilatory sulfite-reductase (dsrB) genes. Sediment samples were collected from two replicate locations, and each location included three sampling stands each covered by monocultures of P. australis, S. alterniflora and both plants (transition stands), respectively. qPCR analysis revealed higher copy numbers of mcrA genes in sediments from S. alterniflora stands than P. australis stands (5- and 7.5-fold more in the spring and summer, respectively), which is consistent with the higher methane flux rates measured in the S. alterniflora stands (up to 8.01 +/- 5.61 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Similar trends were observed for SRB, and they were up to two orders of magnitude higher than the methanogens. Diversity indices indicated a lower diversity of methanogens in the S. alterniflora stands than the P. australis stands. In contrast, insignificant variations were observed in the diversity of SRB with the invasion. Although Methanomicrobiales and Methanococcales, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens, dominated in the salt marsh, Methanomicrobiales displayed a slight increase with the invasion and growth of S. alterniflora, whereas the later responded differently. Methanosarcina, the metabolically diverse methanogens, did not vary with the invasion of, but Methanosaeta, the exclusive acetate utilizers, appeared to increase with S. alterniflora invasion. In SRB, sequences closely related to the families Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae dominated in the salt marsh, although they displayed minimal changes with the S. alterniflora invasion. Approximately 11.3 +/- 5.1% of the dsrB gene sequences formed a novel cluster that was reduced upon the invasion. The results showed that in the sediments of tidal salt marsh where S. alterniflora displaced P. australis, the abundances of methanogens and SRB increased, but the community composition of methanogens appeared to be influenced more than did the SRB.

Since the discovery of symbioses between sulfur-oxidizing (thiotrophic) bacteria and invertebrates at hydrothermal vents over 40 years ago, it has been assumed that autotrophic fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> by the symbionts drives these nutritional associations. In this study, we investigated "<i>Candidatus</i> Kentron," the clade of symbionts hosted by <i>Kentrophoros</i>, a diverse genus of ciliates which are found in marine coastal sediments around the world. Despite being the main food source for their hosts, Kentron bacteria lack the key canonical genes for any of the known pathways for autotrophic carbon fixation and have a carbon stable isotope fingerprint that is unlike other thiotrophic symbionts from similar habitats. Our genomic and transcriptomic analyses instead found metabolic features consistent with growth on organic carbon, especially organic and amino acids, for which they have abundant uptake transporters. All known thiotrophic symbionts have converged on using reduced sulfur to gain energy lithotrophically, but they are diverse in their carbon sources. Some clades are obligate autotrophs, while many are mixotrophs that can supplement autotrophic carbon fixation with heterotrophic capabilities similar to those in Kentron. Here we show that Kentron bacteria are the only thiotrophic symbionts that appear to be entirely heterotrophic, unlike all other thiotrophic symbionts studied to date, which possess either the Calvin-Benson-Bassham or the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle for autotrophy.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many animals and protists depend on symbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria as their main food source. These bacteria use energy from oxidizing inorganic sulfur compounds to make biomass autotrophically from CO<sub>2</sub>, serving as primary producers for their hosts. Here we describe a clade of nonautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing symbionts, "<i>Candidatus</i> Kentron," associated with marine ciliates. They lack genes for known autotrophic pathways and have a carbon stable isotope fingerprint heavier than other symbionts from similar habitats. Instead, they have the potential to oxidize sulfur to fuel the uptake of organic compounds for heterotrophic growth, a metabolic mode called chemolithoheterotrophy that is not found in other symbioses. Although several symbionts have heterotrophic features to supplement primary production, in Kentron they appear to supplant it entirely.

Profiling using 16S rRNA amplicon profiling.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	26989611	Diuron tolerance and potential degradation by pelagic microbiomes in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.	Diuron is a herbicide commonly used in agricultural areas where excess application causes it to leach into rivers, reach sensitive marine environments like the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon and pose risks to marine life. To investigate the impact of diuron on whole prokaryotic communities that underpin the marine food web and are integral to coral reef health, GBR lagoon water was incubated with diuron at environmentally-relevant concentration (8 myg/L), and sequenced at specific time points over the following year. 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling revealed no significant short- or long-term effect of diuron on microbiome structure. The relative abundance of prokaryotic phototrophs was not significantly altered by diuron, which suggests that they were largely tolerant at this concentration. Assembly of a metagenome derived from waters sampled at a similar location in the GBR lagoon did not reveal the presence of mutations in the cyanobacterial photosystem that could explain diuron tolerance. However, resident phages displayed several variants of this gene and could potentially play a role in tolerance acquisition. Slow biodegradation of diuron was reported in the incubation flasks, but no correlation with the relative abundance of heterotrophs was evident. Analysis of metagenomic reads supports the hypothesis that previously uncharacterized hydrolases carried by low-abundance species may mediate herbicide degradation in the GBR lagoon. Overall, this study offers evidence that pelagic phototrophs of the GBR lagoon may be more tolerant of diuron than other tropical organisms, and that heterotrophs in the microbial seed bank may have the potential to degrade diuron and alleviate local anthropogenic stresses to inshore GBR ecosystems.																																													
MGYS00004419	Lake Washington sediment enrichments	In this study, we addressed the role that provided nitrogen plays in determining the composition of methane-consuming communities and the methane oxidation potential in a well-studied model system. We applied a multi-phase approach combining microcosm enrichments and pure culture studies with methane oxidation potential measurements and high throughput sequencing. We focused on incubation conditions with a limited O2 availability as observed in the natural environment. 16S rRNA gene profiling showed that with N2 as the only available nitrogen source, communities were dominated by Methylomonas species as the major methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). In the presence of added nitrate however, Methylobacter species were the dominant MOB. Pure culture studies of Methylomonas and Methylobacter isolated from the same environment and incubated in the same way confirmed that the growth of a Methylomonas strain was not significantly affected when N2 was the only provided nitrogen source, while growth of a Methylobacter strain was negatively impacted. By further exposing long-term methane fed microbial communities to different nitrogen sources, intraspecific dynamics of non-methanotrophic community members were observed, suggesting nitrate as an additional selective factor for co-occurring species. Our results show that provided nitrogen source is an important factor determining specific responses of individual community members and consequently affecting community composition and overall methane consumption.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Sediment

Microbial eukaryotes can play prominent roles in the Arctic marine ecosystem, but their diversity and variability is not well known in the ice-covered ecosystems. We determined the community composition of microbial eukaryotes in an Arctic under-ice spring bloom north of Svalbard using metabarcoding of DNA and RNA from the hypervariable V4 region of 18S nrDNA. At the two stations studied, the photosynthetic biomass was dominated by protists &gt;3 mym and was concentrated in the upper 70-80 m, above the thermocline and halocline. Hierarchical cluster analyses as well as ordination analyses showed a distinct clustering of the microbial eukaryote communities according to a combination of water mass and local environmental characteristics. While samples collected in the surface mixed layer differed distinctly between the two sites, the deeper communities collected in Atlantic Water were fairly similar despite being geographically distant. The differentiation of the microbial eukaryote communities of the upper mixed water was probably driven by local development and advection, while the lack of such differentiation in the communities of Atlantic Water reflects the homogenizing effect of water currents on microbial communities.

Fjords and continental shelves represent distinct marine ecosystems in the pan-arctic region. Kongsfjorden is a glacial fjord that is located on the west coast of Svalbard, and is influenced by both Atlantic and Arctic water masses. The Bering Sea consists of a huge continental shelf in the northeast and a deep ocean basin in the southwest, and is influenced by Pacific water. Microbial community compositions of Arctic sediment samples BJ4 from outer basin and BJ36 from inner basin of Kongsfjorden and sub-Arctic samples NEC5 from shallow shelf and DBS1 from deep basin region of the northern Bering Sea were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Most archaeal sequences in the sediments were related to <i>Thaumarchaeota</i>, though <i>Euryarchaeota</i> were more abundant in the Arctic glacier-influencing inner basin sediment BJ36. <i>Thaumarchaeota</i> Group C3 was the dominant archaeal population in all samples. <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> dominated the sediment bacterial communities. <i>Acidobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i> were also dominant in the northern Bering Sea samples. <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Epsilonproteobacteria</i> were the two main classes in Kongsfjorden sediment bacterial communities while <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> were dominant in the northern Bering Sea sediments. Differences in the presence and abundance of other dominant archaeal and bacterial populations were observed among sediment samples. In contrast to archaeal community differences that the Arctic BJ36 archaeal community was distinct from the sub-Arctic sediments and the Arctic outer basin sediment BJ4, cluster analysis based on bacterial OTU (operational taxonomic unit) distributions indicated that the Arctic and sub-Arctic bacterial communities segregated from one another. These results suggest that the sediment archaeal and bacterial community compositions can be driven by different environmental factors. Differences in the presence and abundance of particular archaeal species (e.g., <i>Candidatus</i> Nitrosopumilus and <i>Methanococcoides</i>) or bacterial species (e.g., <i>Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum</i>, and <i>Desulfobulbaceae</i>) involved in biogeochemical cycles were also observed among sediment samples. At the same time, despite the community variation, some phylotypes (e.g., <i>Marinicella</i>) were dominant in all sediments. This study indicates diverse microbial communities inhabiting pan-arctic marine sediments, and highlights potential roles for <i>Archaea</i> and <i>Bacteria</i> in global biogeochemical cycles in these environments.

MGYS00004364	Deep Subsurface Basalts Targeted Locus (Loci)	Approximately 42% of the continental crust is composed of mafic magmatic rocks, such as basalts. These rocks often manifest themselves as massive areas known as large igneous provinces (LIPs). LIPs cover thousands to millions of square kilometers and thus comprise major portions of the subsurface and the biosphere. LIPs, and more specifically basalts, are known to be chemically reactive and favorable for microbial life due to the abundance of reduced compounds in the rock.  LIPs exist both in marine systems and terrestrial systems. In marine systems, microorganisms are known to extensively interact with minerals in basalt and may play a large role in the global biogeochemical cycles of C, Fe, and S. Sources of energy available to lithoautotrophic microorganisms below the seafloor include minerals containing reduced Fe and S and also H2 generated from water-rock reactions. Hydrogen is of particular interest in terrestrial subsurface basalt systems, where the subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystem (SLiME) hypothesis originated. SLiMEs are microbial communities that subsist in deep oligotrophic environments without utilizing energy rich reduced organic compounds that originated from photosynthesis. SLiMEs were first hypothesized to exist in the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). Basalt systems also host diverse communities apart from SLiMEs, such as microbial communities consisting of iron reducers, sulfate reducers, acetogens, and methanogens. In the basaltic Snake River Plain Aquifer (SRPA) in Idaho, microbial communities cycle carbon by forming and oxidizing methane.  Today, LIPs are being examined as potential geological storage sites for carbon dioxide in an attempt to sequester CO2 away from the atmosphere to alleviate temperature increases due to climate changes. The Wallula pilot well being used for a geologic carbon sequestration project in eastern Washington State and located in the CRBG provides a window to the subsurface where the microbial diversity of these geologically important regions can be explored. In addition, the well will provide insight into the microbial communities present in the basalts that could play a role in carbon cycling in the deep subsurface where supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is injected.  Analyzing samples from the CRBG using deep DNA sequencing technology will further the understanding of the unique microbial diversity of the subsurface, especially with respect to community composition of LIPS and different members contained in different formations. Pyrosequencing will also establish an important baseline for understanding the microbial communities in the aquifers of the Wallula pilot well prior to the injection of scCO2. These communities will certainly change following the injection and pyrosequencing could play a critical role in the analysis of the samples obtained after the injection of scCO2 into the system. The high resolution associated with deep sequencing technology would allow the detection of shifts in the diversity of the microbial communities.  All samples presented here originated from the Wallula pilot well in eastern Washington State. The well penetrates through three Columbia River Basalt formations, the deepest of which is targeted for carbon sequestration. This study aimed to characterize the microbial community prior to the injection of carbon dioxide to provide a baseline for comparison after carbon has been stored in the basalt. Samples Wal213, Wal220, Wal31, Wal39, and Wal413 were collected from pristine formations as the well was drilled using a progressive drill-and-test technique that provides samples more representative of the formation of origin. Quality of the samples was also ensured due to the use of an underbalanced drilling technique in which water from the formation acted as drilling fluid, as well as the collection of samples after extensive pumping of the well. Sample Wal34 was collected 2 years after the completion of the well. The microbial diversity of other locations in the Colombia River Basalt Group has been investigated previously (Stevens et al., 1993; Stevens and McKinley, 1995; Fry et al., 1997), but not at the location of the Wallula pilot well and not using sequencing technology which provides a more complete picture of the microbial community. A more detailed description of the Wallula pilot well can be found in the 2009 report Preliminary Hydrogeologic Characterization Results from the Wallula Pilot Study by McGrail et al. (report number PNWD-4129).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Sediment	23418786	Microbial characterization of basalt formation waters targeted for geological carbon sequestration.	Geological carbon sequestration in basalts is a promising solution to mitigate carbon emissions into the Earth's atmosphere. The Wallula pilot well in Eastern Washington State, USA provides an opportunity to investigate how native microbial communities in basalts are affected by the injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into deep, alkaline formation waters of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Our objective was to characterize the microbial communities at five depth intervals in the Wallula pilot well prior to CO2 injection to establish a baseline community for comparison after the CO2 is injected. Microbial communities were examined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to enumerate bacterial cells and 454 pyrosequencing to compare and contrast the diversity of the native microbial communities. The deepest depth sampled contained the greatest amount of bacterial biomass, as well as the highest bacterial diversity. The shallowest depth sampled harbored the greatest archaeal diversity. Pyrosequencing revealed the well to be dominated by the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, with microorganisms related to hydrogen oxidizers (Hydrogenophaga), methylotrophs (Methylotenera), methanotrophs (Methylomonas), iron reducers (Geoalkalibacter), sulfur oxidizers (Thiovirga), and methanogens (Methermicocccus). Thus, the Wallula pilot well is composed of a unique microbial community in which hydrogen and single-carbon compounds may play a significant role in sustaining the deep biosphere.

Preserving biodiversity is a global challenge requiring data on species' distribution and abundance over large geographic and temporal scales. However, traditional methods to survey mobile species' distribution and abundance in marine environments are often inefficient, environmentally destructive, or resource-intensive. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a new means to assess biodiversity and on much larger scales, but adoption of this approach for surveying whole animal communities in large, dynamic aquatic systems has been slowed by significant unknowns surrounding error rates of detection and relevant spatial resolution of eDNA surveys. Here, we report the results of a 2.5 km eDNA transect surveying the vertebrate fauna present along a gradation of diverse marine habitats associated with a kelp forest ecosystem. Using PCR primers that target the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene of marine fishes and mammals, we generated eDNA sequence data and compared it to simultaneous visual dive surveys. We find spatial concordance between individual species' eDNA and visual survey trends, and that eDNA is able to distinguish vertebrate community assemblages from habitats separated by as little as ~60 m. eDNA reliably detected vertebrates with low false-negative error rates (1/12 taxa) when compared to the surveys, and revealed cryptic species known to occupy the habitats but overlooked by visual methods. This study also presents an explicit accounting of false negatives and positives in metabarcoding data, which illustrate the influence of gene marker selection, replication, contamination, biases impacting eDNA count data and ecology of target species on eDNA detection rates in an open ecosystem.

We survey bacterial and archaeal communities in phylogenetically diverse Australian corals representing more than 425 million years of diversification. We show that corals exhibit anatomical compartmentalization of the microbiome such that the coral surface mucus layer, tissue, and skeleton microbiomes show distinct modern microbial ecology and evolutionary assembly. In corals, these compartments differ greatly in microbial community composition, richness, and response to host vs. environmental drivers. We also find evidence of coral-microbe phylosymbiosis, in which coral microbiome composition and richness reflects coral phylogeny. Surprisingly, the coral skeleton represents the most biodiverse coral microbiome, and also shows the strongest evidence of phylosymbiosis. Together these results trace microbial symbiosis across anatomy during the evolution of a basal animal lineage.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Coral reef	30467310	Coral-associated bacteria demonstrate phylosymbiosis and cophylogeny.

The study was conducted, in part, within introductory microbiology courses at Vassar College (Poughkeepsie, NY) and Williams College (Williamstown, MA). Sequencing was conducted at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA). Winogradsky columns were created from sediment collected near the edge of two small ponds (under approximately 15-30 cm of water) in late October 2008. Ponds were located near the campus of Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts: Buxton Pond (N 42.70o (42 o 42 15)  W 73.2114 o (73 o 12 41) and Ephs Pond (N 42.7201o (42 o 43 12)  W 73.1975 o (73 o 11 51).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Sediment	25101630	16S rRNA gene survey of microbial communities in Winogradsky columns.	A Winogradsky column is a clear glass or plastic column filled with enriched sediment. Over time, microbial communities in the sediment grow in a stratified ecosystem with an oxic top layer and anoxic sub-surface layers. Winogradsky columns have been used extensively to demonstrate microbial nutrient cycling and metabolic diversity in undergraduate microbiology labs. In this study, we used high-throughput 16s rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the microbial diversity of Winogradsky columns. Specifically, we tested the impact of sediment source, supplemental cellulose source, and depth within the column, on microbial community structure. We found that the Winogradsky columns were highly diverse communities but are dominated by three phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. The community is structured by a founding population dependent on the source of sediment used to prepare the columns and is differentiated by depth within the column. Numerous biomarkers were identified distinguishing sample depth, including Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria as biomarkers of the soil-water interface, and Clostridia as a biomarker of the deepest depth. Supplemental cellulose source impacted community structure but less strongly than depth and sediment source. In columns dominated by Firmicutes, the family Peptococcaceae was the most abundant sulfate reducer, while in columns abundant in Proteobacteria, several Deltaproteobacteria families, including Desulfobacteraceae, were found, showing that different taxonomic groups carry out sulfur cycling in different columns. This study brings this historical method for enrichment culture of chemolithotrophs and other soil bacteria into the modern era of microbiology and demonstrates the potential of the Winogradsky column as a model system for investigating the effect of environmental variables on soil microbial communities.

Marine microbial eukaryotes are ubiquitous, comprised of phylogenetically diverse groups and play key roles in microbial food webs and global biogeochemical cycling. However, their vertical distribution in the deep sea has received little attention. In this study, we investigated the composition and diversity of the eukaryotes of both 0.2-3 mym and &gt;3 mym size fractions from the surface to the hadal zone (8727 m) of the Mariana Trench using Illumina MiSeq sequencing for the 18S rDNA. The microbial eukaryotic community structure differed substantially across size fractions and depths. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness in the &gt;3 mym fraction was higher than that in the 0.2-3 mym fraction at the same depth. For the 0.2-3 mym fraction, sequences of Retaria (Rhizaria) were most abundant in the surface water (53.5%). Chrysophyceae (Stramenopiles) sequences dominated mostly in the samples from water depths below 1795 m. For the &gt;3 mym fraction, sequences of Dinophyceae (Alveolata) were most abundant in surface waters (49.3%) and remained a significant proportion of total sequences at greater depths (9.8%, on average). Retaria sequences were abundant in samples of depths >=1000 m. Amoebozoa and Apusozoa sequences were enriched in the hadal sample, comprising 38 and 20.4% of total sequences, respectively. Fungi (Opisthokonta) sequences were most abundant at 1759 m in both size fractions. Strong positive associations were found between Syndiniales (mainly MALV-I and MALV-II) and Retaria while negative associations were shown between MALV-II and Fungi in a co-occurrence analysis. This study compared the community structure of microbial eukaryotes in different zones in the deep sea and identified a distinct hadal community in the larger size fraction, suggesting the uniqueness of the eukaryotes in the biosphere in the Mariana Trench.

The Mexican region of the Perdido Fold Belt (PFB), in northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GoM), is a geological province with important oil reservoirs that will be subjected to forthcoming oil exploration and extraction activities. To date, little is known about the native microbial communities of this region, and how these change relative to water depth. In this study we assessed the bacterial community structure of surficial sediments by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene at 11 sites in the PFB, along a water column depth gradient from 20 to 3,700 m, including five shallow (20-600 m) and six deep (2,800-3,700 m) samples. The results indicated that OTUs richness and diversity were higher for shallow sites (OTUs = 2,888.2 +/- 567.88; <i>H</i>' = 9.6 +/- 0.85) than for deep sites (OTUs = 1,884.7 +/- 464.2; <i>H</i>' = 7.74 +/- 1.02). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination revealed that shallow microbial communities grouped separately from deep samples. Additionally, the shallow sites plotted further from each other on the NMDS whereas samples from the deeper sites (abyssal plains) plotted much more closely to each other. These differences were related to depth, redox potential, sulfur concentration, and grain size (lime and clay), based on the environmental variables fitted with the axis of the NMDS ordination. In addition, differential abundance analysis identified 147 OTUs with significant fold changes among the zones (107 from shallow and 40 from deep sites), which constituted 10 to 40% of the total relative abundances of the microbial communities. The most abundant OTUs with significant fold changes in shallow samples corresponded to <i>Kordiimonadales, Rhodospirillales</i>, <i>Desulfobacterales</i> (<i>Desulfococcus</i>)<i>, Syntrophobacterales and Nitrospirales</i> (<i>GOUTA 19</i>, <i>BD2-6</i>, <i>LCP-6</i>), whilst <i>Chromatiales</i>, <i>Oceanospirillales</i> (<i>Amphritea</i>, <i>Alcanivorax</i>), <i>Methylococcales</i>, <i>Flavobacteriales</i>, <i>Alteromonadales</i> (<i>Shewanella</i>, <i>ZD0117</i>) and <i>Rhodobacterales</i> were the better represented taxa in deep samples. Several of the OTUs detected in both deep and shallow sites have been previously related to hydrocarbons consumption. Thus, this metabolism seems to be well represented in the studied sites, and it could abate future hydrocarbon contamination in this ecosystem. The results presented herein, along with biological and physicochemical data, constitute an available reference for further monitoring of the bacterial communities in this economically important region in the GoM.																																													
MGYS00004504	Bacterial community structure and their predicted functions in coastal sediments	The main objectives of the present study were investigation of bacterial community compositions and their predicted functions in coastal sediments, considering the impacts of natural processes and anthropogenic activities.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment	33123107	Evaluating the Potential Antibiotic Resistance Status in Environment Based on the Trait of Microbial Community.	The overuse of antibiotics has promoted the propagation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environment. Due to the dense human population and intensive activities in coastal areas, the health risk of ARGs in coastal environment is becoming a severe problem. To date, there still lacks of a quantitative method to assess properly the gross antibiotic resistance at microbial community level. Here, we collected sediment samples from Hangzhou Bay (HB), Taizhou Bay (TB), and Xiangshan Bay (XB) of the East China Sea for community-level ARGs analysis. Based on the 16S rRNA genes and predictive metagenomics, we predicted the composition of intrinsic ARGs (piARGs) and some related functional groups. Firstly, a total of 40 piARG subtypes, belonging to nine drug classes and five resistance mechanisms, were obtained, among which the piARGs encoding multidrug efflux pumps were the most dominant in the three bays. Secondly, XB had higher relative abundances of piARGs and pathogens than the other two bays, which posed higher potential health risk and implied the heavier impact of long-term maricultural activities in this bay. Thirdly, the co-occurrence network analysis identified that there were more connections between piARGs and some potential pathogenic bacteria. Several piARG subtypes (e.g., <i>tetA</i>, <i>aacA</i>, <i>aacC</i>, and <i>aadK</i>) distributed widely in the microbial communities. And finally, the microbial diversity correlated negatively with the relative abundance of piARGs. Oil, salinity, and arsenic had significant effects on the variations of piARGs and potential pathogenic bacteria. The abundance-weighted average ribosomal RNA operon (<i>rrn</i>) copy number of microbial communities could be regarded as an indicator to evaluate the antibiotic resistance status. In conclusion, this study provides a new insight on how to evaluate antibiotic resistance status and their potential risk in environment based on a quantitative analysis of microbial communities.

The pure culture of prokaryotes remains essential to elucidating the role of these organisms. Scientists have reasoned that hard to cultivate microorganisms might grow in pure culture if provided with the chemical components of their natural environment. However, most microbial species in the biosphere that would otherwise be "culturable" may fail to grow because of their growth state in nature, such as dormancy. That means even if scientist would provide microorganisms with the natural environment, such dormant microorganisms probably still remain in a dormant state. We constructed an enrichment culture system for high-efficiency isolation of uncultured strains from marine sediment. Degree of enrichment analysis, dormant and active taxa calculation, viable but non-culturable bacteria resuscitation analysis, combined with metatranscriptomic and comparative genomic analyses of the interactions between microbial communications during enrichment culture showed that the so-called enrichment method could culture the "uncultured" not only through enriching the abundance of "uncultured," but also through the resuscitation mechanism. In addition, the enrichment culture was a complicated mixed culture system, which contains the competition, cooperation, or coordination among bacterial communities, compared with pure cultures. Considering that cultivation techniques must evolve further-from axenic to mixed cultures-for us to fully understand the microbial world, we should redevelop an understanding of the classic enrichment culture method. Enrichment culture methods can be developed and used to construct a model for analyzing mixed cultures and exploring microbial dark matter. This study provides a new train of thought to mining marine microbial dark matter based on mixed cultures.																																													
MGYS00005832	Multi-omics of the nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing culture BP	Nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing (NDFO) bacteria are widespread in the environment contribute to nitrate removal and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. A second NDFO culture, culture BP, was obtained with a sample taken in 2015 at the same pond and cultured in a similar way. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture BP.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture BP and of environmental samples from the pond where culture BP originates from.

Fe(II) oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction (NRFO) has been described for many environments. Yet very few autotrophic microorganisms catalysing NRFO have been cultivated and their diversity, as well as their mechanisms for NRFO in situ remain unclear. A novel autotrophic NRFO enrichment culture, named culture BP, was obtained from freshwater sediment. After more than 20 transfers, culture BP oxidized 8.22 mM of Fe(II) and reduced 2.42 mM of nitrate within 6.5 days under autotrophic conditions. We applied metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic analyses to culture BP to identify the microorganisms involved in autotrophic NRFO and to unravel their metabolism. Overall, twelve metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed, including a dominant Gallionellaceae sp. MAG (>=71% relative abundance). Genes and transcripts associated with potential Fe(II) oxidizers in culture BP, identified as a Gallionellaceae sp., Noviherbaspirillum sp., and Thiobacillus sp., were likely involved in metal oxidation (e.g., cyc2, mtoA), denitrification (e.g., nirK/S, norBC), carbon fixation (e.g., rbcL), and oxidative phosphorylation. The putative Fe(II)-oxidizing protein Cyc2 was detected for the Gallionellaceae sp. Overall, a complex network of microbial interactions among several Fe(II) oxidizers and denitrifiers was deciphered in culture BP that might resemble NRFO mechanisms in situ. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from environmental samples revealed 36 distinct Gallionellaceae taxa, including the key player of NRFO from culture BP (approx. 0.13% relative abundance in situ). Since several of these in situ-detected Gallionellaceae taxa were closely related to the key player in culture BP, this suggests that the diversity of organisms contributing to NRFO might be higher than currently known.

MGYS00004006	Ocean Targeted Locus (Loci)	The cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are important marine primary producers. We explored their distributions and co-variance along a physico-chemical gradient from coastal to open ocean waters in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing we identified two new clades of Synechococcus, EPC1 and EPC2, and delineated an interannual pattern in a dynamic transition zone where upwelled and eastern boundary current waters mix. In years when more oligotrophic water intrudes further inshore Prochlorococcus HLI and LLI are more abundant, while under stronger upwelling Synechococcus I and IV dominate. However, contributions of some cyanobacterial clades are proportionally relatively constant, e.g., Synechococcus EPC2. In addition to supporting observations that Prochlorococcus LLI thrive at higher irradiances than other LL taxa, the results suggest LLI tolerate lower temperatures than reported. The phylogenetic precision of our analytical approach and depth of barcoded pyrosequencing also allowed us to detect clades at low abundance in unexpected places. For example, Prochlorococcus at the coast, and sequences related to freshwater Cyanobium spp. in the open ocean, although it remains unclear whether these come from resident or advected cells. Our study enhances understanding of cyanobacterial distributions by applying state-of-the-art phylogenetic analysis tools to an ecologically important eastern boundary system.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine																																																
MGYS00003699	Geographic distance and pH drive bacterial distribution in alkaline lake sediments across Tibetan Plateau	Continent-scale biogeography has been extensively studied in soils and marine systems, but little is known about biogeographical patterns in non-marine sediments. We used barcode pyrosequencing to quantify the effects of local geochemical properties and geographic distance for bacterial community structure and membership, using sediment samples from 15 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (4–1670 km apart). Bacterial communities were surprisingly diverse, and distinct from soil communities. Four of 26 phyla detected were dominant: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, albeit 20.2% of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. As previously observed in acidic soil, pH was the dominant factor influencing alkaline sediment community structure, phylotype richness and phylogenetic diversity. In contrast, archaeal communities were less affected by pH. More geographically distant sites had more dissimilar communities (r = 0.443, P = 0.030). Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (12.2%) than any other factor, although the environmental factors explained more variance when combined (28.9%). Together, our results show that pH is the best predictor of bacterial community structure in alkaline sediments, and confirm that both geographic distance and chemical factors govern bacterial biogeography in lake sediments.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Sediment	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

Methane seepages typically harbor communities of anaerobic methane oxidizers (ANME); however, knowledge about fine-scale vertical variation of ANME in response to geochemical gradients is limited. We investigated microbial communities in sediments below a white microbial mat in the G11 pockmark at Nyegga by 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing and real-time quantitative PCR. A vertical stratification of dominating ANME communities was observed at 4 cmbsf (cm below seafloor) and below in the following order: ANME-2a/b, ANME-1 and ANME-2c. The ANME-1 community was most numerous and comprised single or chains of cells with typical rectangular morphology, accounting up to 89.2% of the retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequences. Detection rates for sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria possibly involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane were low throughout the core. However, a correlation in the abundance of Candidate division JS-1 with ANME-2 was observed, indicating involvement in metabolisms occurring in ANME-2-dominated horizons. The white microbial mat and shallow sediments were dominated by organisms affiliated with Sulfurovum (Epsilonproteobacteria) and Methylococcales (Gammaproteobacteria), suggesting that aerobic oxidation of sulfur and methane is taking place. In intermediate horizons, typical microbial groups associated with methane seeps were recovered. The data are discussed with respect to co-occurring microbial assemblages and interspecies interactions.

The brackish Baltic Sea is under diesel oil pollution risk due to heavy ship traffic. The situation is exasperated by densely distributed marinas and a vigorous although seasonal recreational boating. The seasonality and physical environmental variations hamper the monitoring of microbial communities in response to diesel oil spills. Hence, an 8-week simulation experiment was established in metal basins (containing 265 L sea water and 18 kg quartz sand or natural shore sand as the littoral sediment) to study the effect of accidental diesel oil spills on microbial communities. Our results demonstrated that microbial communities in the surface water responded to diesel oil contamination, whereas those in the littoral sediment did not, indicating that diesel oil degradation mainly happened in the water. Diesel oil decreased the abundance of bacteria and fungi, but increased bacterial diversity in the water. Time was the predominant driver of microbial succession, attributable to the adaption strategies of microbes. Bacteria were more sensitive to diesel oil contamination than fungi and archaea. Diesel oil increased relative abundances of bacterial phyla, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia and Cytophagia, and fungal phylum Ascomycota in the surface water. Overall, this study improves the understanding of the immediate ecological impact of accidental diesel oil contamination, providing insights into risk management at the coastal area.																																													
MGYS00004185	Distinctive Microbial Community Structure in Highly Stratified Deep-Sea Brine Water Columns	Atlantis II and Discovery are two hydrothermal and hypersaline deep-sea pools in the Red Sea rift that are characterised by strong thermo-halo stratification and temperatures steadily peaking near the bottom. We conducted comprehensive vertical profiling of the microbial populations in both pools and highlighted the influential environmental factors. Pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA genes) revealed shifts in community structures vis-à-vis depth. High diversity and low abundance were the features of the deepest convective layers despite the low cell density. Surprisingly, the brine interfaces were significantly higher in cell count, compared with the overlying deep-sea water, yet they were lowest in diversity. Vertical stratification of the bacterial populations was apparent as we move from the Alphaproteobacteria-dominated deep-sea to the Planctomycetacia or Deferribacteres-dominated interfaces to the Gammaproteobacteria-dominated brine layers. The archaeal marine group I was dominant in the deep-sea water and interfaces; whilst several euryarchaeotic groups increased in the brine. Across sites, microbial phylotypes and abundances varied substantially in the brine interface of Discovery compared with Atlantis II; despite the near-identical populations in the overlaying deep-sea waters. The lowest convective layers harboured interestingly similar microbial communities, even though temperature and heavy metal concentrations were very different. Multivariate analysis indicated that temperature and salinity were the major influences shaping the communities. The harsh conditions and the low-abundance phylotypes could explain the observed correlation in the brine pools.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

The effect of plant invasion on the microorganisms of soil sediments is very important for estuary ecology. The community structures of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) as a function of Spartina alterniflora invasion in Phragmites australis-vegetated sediments of the Dongtan wetland in the Yangtze River estuary, China, were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of the methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) and dissimilatory sulfite-reductase (dsrB) genes. Sediment samples were collected from two replicate locations, and each location included three sampling stands each covered by monocultures of P. australis, S. alterniflora and both plants (transition stands), respectively. qPCR analysis revealed higher copy numbers of mcrA genes in sediments from S. alterniflora stands than P. australis stands (5- and 7.5-fold more in the spring and summer, respectively), which is consistent with the higher methane flux rates measured in the S. alterniflora stands (up to 8.01 +/- 5.61 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Similar trends were observed for SRB, and they were up to two orders of magnitude higher than the methanogens. Diversity indices indicated a lower diversity of methanogens in the S. alterniflora stands than the P. australis stands. In contrast, insignificant variations were observed in the diversity of SRB with the invasion. Although Methanomicrobiales and Methanococcales, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens, dominated in the salt marsh, Methanomicrobiales displayed a slight increase with the invasion and growth of S. alterniflora, whereas the later responded differently. Methanosarcina, the metabolically diverse methanogens, did not vary with the invasion of, but Methanosaeta, the exclusive acetate utilizers, appeared to increase with S. alterniflora invasion. In SRB, sequences closely related to the families Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae dominated in the salt marsh, although they displayed minimal changes with the S. alterniflora invasion. Approximately 11.3 +/- 5.1% of the dsrB gene sequences formed a novel cluster that was reduced upon the invasion. The results showed that in the sediments of tidal salt marsh where S. alterniflora displaced P. australis, the abundances of methanogens and SRB increased, but the community composition of methanogens appeared to be influenced more than did the SRB.																																													
MGYS00004326	Targeted analyses of Dehalococcoidetes (phylum Chloroflexi) diversity and community structures in marine subsurface sediments.	Bacteria of the class Dehalococcoidetes (phylum Chloroflexi) are widely distributed in the subsurface and are especially prevalent in the deep marine subsurface.

Nitrification is a vital ecosystem function in the open ocean that regenerates inorganic nitrogen and promotes primary production. Recent studies have shown that the ecology and physiology of nitrifying organisms is more complex than previously postulated. The distribution of these organisms in the remote oligotrophic ocean and their interactions with the physicochemical environment are relatively understudied. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the depth profile of nitrifying archaea and bacteria in the Eastern North Pacific Subtropical Front, an area with limited biological surveys but with intense trophic transferences and physicochemical gradients. Furthermore, we investigated the dominant physicochemical and biological relationships within and between ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) as well as with the overall prokaryotic community. We used a 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to identify and characterize the nitrifying groups within the first 500 m of the water column and to analyze their abiotic and biotic interactions. The water column was characterized mainly by two contrasting environments, warm O<sub>2</sub>-rich surface waters with low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and a cold O<sub>2</sub>-deficient mesopelagic layer with high concentrations of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>). Thaumarcheotal AOA and bacterial NOB were highly abundant below the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and in the mesopelagic. In the mesopelagic, AOA and NOB represented up to 25 and 3% of the total prokaryotic community, respectively. Interestingly, the AOA community in the mesopelagic was dominated by unclassified genera that may constitute a novel group of AOA highly adapted to the conditions observed at those depths. Several of these unclassified amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were positively correlated with NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> concentrations and negatively correlated with temperature and O<sub>2</sub>, whereas known thaumarcheotal genera exhibited the opposite behavior. Additionally, we found a large network of positive interactions within and between putative nitrifying ASVs and other prokaryotic groups, including 13230 significant correlations and 23 sub-communities of AOA, AOB, NOB, irrespective of their taxonomic classification. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the roles that AOA may play in recycling inorganic nitrogen in the oligotrophic ocean, with potential consequences to primary production in these remote ecosystems.																																													
MGYS00005530	Niche partitioning of methanotrophs in stratified lakes	A detailed sampling of the water column in proximity to the oxygen-methane interface of four stratified Swiss lakes was performed. Amplicon sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA and pmoA genes and 16S rRNA and pmoA transcripts was used to investigate the active methane-oxidizing bacteria inhabiting the oxygen-methane resource gradient.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lake	31624343	Niche partitioning of methane-oxidizing bacteria along the oxygen-methane counter gradient of stratified lakes.	Lakes are a significant source of atmospheric methane, although methane-oxidizing bacteria consume most methane diffusing upward from anoxic sediments. Diverse methane-oxidizing bacteria form an effective methane filter in the water column of stratified lakes, yet, niche partitioning of different methane-oxidizing bacteria along the oxygen-methane counter gradient remains poorly understood. In our study, we reveal vertical distribution patterns of active methane-oxidizing bacteria along the oxygen-methane counter gradient of four lakes, based on amplicon sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA and pmoA genes, and 16S rRNA and pmoA transcripts, and potential methane oxidation rates. Differential distribution patterns indicated that ecologically different methane-oxidizing bacteria occupied the methane-deficient and oxygen-deficient part above and below the oxygen-methane interface. The interface sometimes harbored additional taxa. Within the dominant Methylococcales, an uncultivated taxon (CABC2E06) occurred mainly under methane-deficient conditions, whereas Crenothrix-related taxa preferred oxygen-deficient conditions. Candidatus Methylomirabilis limnetica (NC10 phylum) abundantly populated the oxygen-deficient part in two of four lakes. We reason that the methane filter in lakes is structured and that methane-oxidizing bacteria may rely on niche-specific adaptations for methane oxidation along the oxygen-methane counter gradient. Niche partitioning of methane-oxidizing bacteria might support greater overall resource consumption, contributing to the high effectivity of the lacustrine methane filter.

Seafloor sediments cover the majority of planet Earth and microorganisms inhabiting these environments play a central role in marine biogeochemical cycles. Yet, description of the biogeography and distribution of sedimentary microbial life is still too sparse to evaluate the relative contribution of processes driving this distribution, such as the levels of drift, connectivity, and specialization. To address this question, we analyzed 210 archaeal and bacterial metabarcoding libraries from a standardized and horizon-resolved collection of sediment samples from 18 stations along a longitudinal gradient from the eastern Mediterranean to the western Atlantic. Overall, we found that biogeographic patterns depended on the scale considered: while at local scale the selective influence of contemporary environmental conditions appeared strongest, the heritage of historic processes through dispersal limitation and drift became more apparent at regional scale, and ended up superseding contemporary influences at inter-regional scale. When looking at environmental factors, the structure of microbial communities was correlated primarily with water depth, with a clear transition between 800 and 1,200 meters below sea level. Oceanic basin, water temperature, and sediment depth were other important explanatory parameters of community structure. Finally, we propose increasing dispersal limitation and ecological drift with sediment depth as a probable factor for the enhanced divergence of deeper horizons communities.	34103697	Microbial community structure in hadal sediments: high similarity along trench axes and strong changes along redox gradients.	Hadal trench sediments are hotspots of biogeochemical activity in the deep sea, but the biogeochemical and ecological factors that shape benthic hadal microbial communities remain unknown. Here, we sampled ten hadal sites from two trench regions with a vertical resolution of down to 1 cm. We sequenced 16S rRNA gene amplicons using universal and archaea-specific primer sets and compared the results to biogeochemical parameters. Despite bathymetric and depositional heterogeneity we found a high similarity of microbial communities within each of the two trench axes, while composition at the phylum level varied strongly with sediment depth in conjunction with the redox stratification into oxic, nitrogenous, and ferruginous zones. As a result, communities of a given sediment horizon were more similar to each other across a distance of hundreds of kilometers within each trench, than to those of adjacent horizons from the same sites separated only by centimeters. Total organic carbon content statistically only explained a small part of the variation within and between trenches, and did not explain the community differences observed between the hadal and adjacent shallower sites. Anaerobic taxa increased in abundance at the top of the ferruginous zone, seeded by organisms deposited at the sediment surface and surviving burial through the upper redox zones. While an influence of other potential factors such as geographic isolation, hydrostatic pressure, and non-steady state depositional regimes could not be discerned, redox stratification and diagenesis appear to be the main selective forces that structure community composition in hadal sediments.

The massive production and improper disposal of organohalides resulted in worldwide contamination in soil and water. However, their environmental survey based on chromatographic methods was hindered by challenges in testing the extremely wide variety of organohalides. <i>Dehalococcoides</i> as obligate organohalide-respiring bacteria exclusively use organohalides as electron acceptors to support their growth, of which the presence could be coupled with organohalides and, therefore, could be employed as a biomarker of the organohalide pollution. In this study, <i>Dehalococcoides</i> was screened in various samples of bioreactors and subsurface environments, showing the wide distribution of <i>Dehalococcoides</i> in sludge and sediment. Further laboratory cultivation confirmed the dechlorination activities of those <i>Dehalococcoides</i>. Among those samples, <i>Dehalococcoides</i> accounting for 1.8% of the total microbial community was found in an anaerobic granular sludge sample collected from a full-scale bioreactor treating petroleum wastewater. Experimental evidence suggested that the influent wastewater in the bioreactor contained bromomethane which support the growth of <i>Dehalococcoides</i>. This study demonstrated that <i>Dehalococcoides</i> could be employed as a promising biomarker to test the present of organohalides in wastestreams or other environmental samples.

Metagenomics of marine sediments has uncovered a broad diversity of new uncultured taxa and provided insights into their metabolic capabilities. Here, we detected microbial lineages from a sediment core near the Jiulong methane reef of the northern South China Sea (at 1,100-m depth). Assembly and binning of the metagenomes resulted in 11 genomes (&gt;85% complete) that represented nine distinct phyla, including candidate phyla TA06 and LCP-89, <i>Lokiarchaeota</i>, <i>Heimdallarchaeota</i>, and a newly described globally distributed phylum (B38). The genome of LCP-89 has pathways for nitrate, selenate, and sulfate reduction, suggesting that they may be involved in mediating these important processes. B38 are able to participate in the cycling of hydrogen and selenocompounds. Many of these uncultured microbes may also be capable of autotrophic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, as exemplified by identification of the Wood-Ljungdahl (W-L) pathway. Genes encoding carbohydrate degradation, W-L pathway, Rnf-dependent energy conservation, and Ni/Fe hydrogenases were detected in the transcriptomes of these novel members. Characterization of these new lineages provides insight to the undescribed branches in the tree of life.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Sedimentary microorganisms in the South China Sea (SCS) remain largely unknown due to the complexity of sediment communities impacted by continent rifting and extension. Distinct geochemical environments may breed special microbial communities including microbes that are still enigmatic. Functional inference of their metabolisms and transcriptional activity provides insight in the ecological roles and substrate-based interactivity of these uncultured <i>Archaea</i> and <i>Bacteria</i> These microorganisms play different roles in utilizing inorganic carbon and scavenging diverse organic compounds involved in the deep-sea carbon cycle. The genomes recovered here contributed undescribed species to the tree of life and laid the foundation for future study on these novel phyla persisting in marginal sediments of the SCS.

MGYS00004107	Identification and activity of acetate-assimilating microorganisms in diffuse hydrothermal fluids	In diffuse hydrothermal fluids concentrations of organic compounds such as acetate can be significant. To date knowledge about mixo- and heterotrophic microorganisms in hydrothermal systems is derived from pure cultures only. We set out to identify acetate-consuming microorganisms in diffuse fluids from two distinct hydrothermal systems using cultivation-independent approaches. For this purpose we combined a characterization of the microbial community in fluids with short-term incubations (8-12 h) using 13C-labeled acetate at low concentrations (10 or 30 µM). We followed cell growth and assimilation of 13C into single cells by nanoSIMS combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In 55°C fluids from the Menez Gwen system, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a novel epsilonproteobacterial group related to Nautiliales accounted for nearly all acetate-assimilating cells. In contrast, in 4°C and 37°C fluids from the Manus Basin (Papua New Guinea) Gammaproteobacteria dominated the 13C-acetate-assimilating community, which was supported by 16S rRNA sequences related to Marinobacter and Alteromonas. We also detected yet unidentified, weakly acetate assimilating cells in 72°C fluids (Manus Basin) that were presumably related to Acinetobacter. In particular in the 37°C and 55°C incubations the microbial communities differed from those in native fluids indicating rapid growth of heterotrophic organisms. The instant response suggests that acetate-consumers in diffuse fluids are r-strategists, which quickly exploit their food sources whenever available under the spatially and temporally highly fluctuating conditions at hydrothermal vents. Our data provide first insights into a largely under-investigated part of microbial carbon cycling at hydrothermal vents and reveals potential roles of known and yet unknown heterotrophic microorganisms in these systems.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Hydrothermal vents

Metagenomics has revealed the existence of numerous uncharacterized viral lineages, which are referred to as viral "dark matter." However, our knowledge regarding viral genomes is biased toward culturable viruses. In this study, we analyzed 1,600 (1,352 nonredundant) complete double-stranded DNA viral genomes (10 to 211 kb) assembled from 52 marine viromes. Together with 244 previously reported uncultured viral genomes, a genome-wide comparison delineated 617 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for these environmental viral genomes (EVGs). Of these, 600 OTUs contained no representatives from known viruses, thus putatively corresponding to novel viral genera. Predicted hosts of the EVGs included major groups of marine prokaryotes, such as marine group II <i>Euryarchaeota</i> and SAR86, from which no viruses have been isolated to date, as well as <i>Flavobacteriaceae</i> and SAR116. Our analysis indicates that marine cyanophages are already well represented in genome databases and that one of the EVGs likely represents a new cyanophage lineage. Several EVGs encode many enzymes that appear to function for an efficient utilization of iron-sulfur clusters or to enhance host survival. This suggests that there is a selection pressure on these marine viruses to accumulate genes for specific viral propagation strategies. Finally, we revealed that EVGs contribute to a 4-fold increase in the recruitment of photic-zone viromes compared with the use of current reference viral genomes. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viruses are diverse and play significant ecological roles in marine ecosystems. However, our knowledge of genome-level diversity in viruses is biased toward those isolated from few culturable hosts. Here, we determined 1,352 nonredundant complete viral genomes from marine environments. Lifting the uncertainty that clouds short incomplete sequences, whole-genome-wide analysis suggests that these environmental genomes represent hundreds of putative novel viral genera. Predicted hosts include dominant groups of marine bacteria and archaea with no isolated viruses to date. Some of the viral genomes encode many functionally related enzymes, suggesting a strong selection pressure on these marine viruses to control cellular metabolisms by accumulating genes.

This study investigated the interaction of the macrophyte Acorus calamus and sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFC) during the degradation of high molecular weight-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW-PAHs) in sediments. Over 367-days, the combination of macrophyte and SMFC led to an increase in pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene degradation rates by at least 70% compared to SMFC or macrophyte alone. While either the macrophyte or SMFC increased redox potential in sediments, redox potentials near the anode (approximately 6 cm depth) in the macrophyte-SMFC combination were markedly lower than that in the only macrophyte treatment. Moreover, rhizospheric bacterial communities in macrophyte-SMFC and macrophyte treatments were distinctly different. Aerobic genera (Vogesella, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Rhizobium) and anaerobic genera (Longilinea, Bellilinea, Desulfobacca and Anaeromyxobacter) became dominant in the rhizosphere in macrophyte and macrophyte-SMFC treatments, respectively. In addition, the macrophyte-SMFC combination improved the numbers of not only aerobic but anaerobic PAHs degraders in sediments. So, the SMFC employment facilitated the formation of anoxic zones in sediments with oxygen loss and exudates from the roots. As a result, cooperation of anaerobic/aerobic microbial metabolism for accelerating HMW-PAHs removal occurred within sediments after combining macrophytes with SMFC.

MGYS00004670	Bacteria of the genus Endozoicomonas dominate the microbial communities of the Mediterranean gorgonian soft coral Eunicella cavolini	Forming dense beds that provide the structural basis of a distinct ecosystem, the gorgonian Eunicella cavolini (Octocorallia) is an important species in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the importance and prevalence of this temperate gorgonian, little is known about its microbial assemblage although bacteria are well known to be important to hard and soft coral functioning. Here, we used massively parallel pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to determine the composition and relative abundances of bacteria associated with E. cavolini collected from different depths at a site on the French Mediterranean coast. We found that whereas the bacterial assemblages of E. cavolini were distinct and less diverse than those of the surrounding water column, the water depth did not affect the bacterial assemblages of this gorgonian. Our data show that E. cavolini's microbiome contains only a few shared species and that it is highly dominated by bacteria from the genus Endozoicomonas, a gamma-Proteobacteria that is frequently found to associate with marine invertebrates.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine																																																
MGYS00004396	Sediment bacterial diversity	This study investigated the effects of salmonid aquaculture on microbial diversity and community composition of sediments in Chiloe, southern Chile using Roche 454 GS-FLX of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.

Bacterial communities were found to differ significantly between reference and aquaculture sites, but OTU richness was not significantly different between sites. The bacterial groups significantly enriched in aquaculture sites were genera belonging to Bacteroidetes (Flavobacteria) and Gammaproteobacteria, which play key roles in organic matter mineralization and sulfur oxidation. These findings show that current practices related to Chilean salmonid aquaculture alter the structure and functionality of marine microbial communities in sediments and suggest major changes in the biogeochemical processes.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Sediment

Pockmarks are crater-like depression on the seafloor associated with hydrocarbon ascent through muddy sediments in continental shelves around the world. In this study, we examine the diversity and distribution of benthic microbial communities at shallow-water pockmarks adjacent to the Middle Adriatic Ridge. We integrate microbial diversity data with characterization of local hydrocarbons concentrations and sediment geochemistry. Our results suggest these pockmarks are enriched in sedimentary hydrocarbons, and host a microbial community dominated by Bacteria, even in deeper sediment layers. Pockmark sediments showed higher prokaryotic abundance and biomass than surrounding sediments, potentially due to the increased availability of organic matter and higher concentrations of hydrocarbons linked to pockmark activity. Prokaryotic diversity analyses showed that the microbial communities of these shallow-water pockmarks are unique, and comprised phylotypes associated with the cycling of sulfur and nitrate compounds, as well as numerous know hydrocarbon degraders. Altogether, this study suggests that shallow-water pockmark habitats enhance the diversity of the benthic prokaryotic biosphere by providing specialized environmental niches.

The 37f hypervariable region of the foraminiferal SSU rDNA was PCR amplified and PCR products were pooled in one library for Illumiona MiSeq sequence and diversity analyses.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment																																																
MGYS00004443	Metagenomics Cabo Rojo Salterns	Culture independent study of microbial communities in hypersaline environments in a tropical solar saltern in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. This project aims to determine the diversity present using direct 16S rRNA amplification. A different diversity is expected due to the stable conditions year round which in turn may lead to identification of new species.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Non-marine Saline and Alkaline:Salt crystallizer pond	31159288	Temporal Analysis of the Microbial Community from the Crystallizer Ponds in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, Using Metagenomics.	The Cabo Rojo solar salterns are a hypersaline environment located in a tropical climate, where conditions remain stable throughout the year. These conditions can favor the establishment of steady microbial communities. Little is known about the microbial composition that thrives in hypersaline environments in the tropics. The main goal of this study was to assess the microbial diversity present in the crystallizer ponds of Cabo Rojo, in terms of structure and metabolic processes across time using metagenomic techniques. Three samplings (December 2014, March and July 2016) were carried out, where water samples (50 L each) were filtered through a Millipore pressurized filtering system. DNA was subsequently extracted using physical-chemical methods and sequenced using paired end Illumina technologies. The sequencing effort produced three paired end libraries with a total of 111,816,040 reads, that were subsequently assembled into three metagenomes. Out of the phyla detected, the microbial diversity was dominated in all three samples by <i>Euryarchaeota,</i> followed by <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Proteobacteria.</i> However, sample MFF1 (for Muestreo Final Fraternidad) exhibited a higher diversity, with 12 prokaryotic phyla detected at 34% NaCl (w/v), when compared to samples MFF2 and MFF3, which only exhibited three phyla. Precipitation events might be one of the contributing factors to the change in the microbial community composition through time. Diversity at genus level revealed a more stable community structure, with an overwhelming dominance of the square archaeon <i>Haloquadratum</i> in the three metagenomes. Furthermore, functional annotation was carried out in order to detect genes related to metabolic processes, such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. The presence of gene sequences related to nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation, and phosphate solubilization were detected. Through binning methods, four putative novel genomes were obtained, including a possible novel genus belonging to the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and possible new species for the genera <i>Natronomonas, Halomicrobium</i>, and <i>Haloquadratum</i>. Using a metagenomic approach, a 3-year study has been performed in a Caribbean hypersaline environment. When compared to other salterns around the world, the Cabo Rojo salterns harbor a similar community composition, which is stable through time. Moreover, an analysis of gene composition highlights the importance of the microbial community in the biogeochemical cycles at hypersaline environments.

MGYS00004462	16S rDNA metagenomes of Western Balkans glacial lakes sediments	Since the Balkan Peninsula is situated in the climatic transition between the temperate zone and Mediterranean conditions, it can be assumed that this region will become dryer and warmer in the course of global climatic change. Potential vanishing of glaciers in this part of Europe could endanger existing glacial lakes, which points to the need of conservation and biodiversity studies of this ecological niche. The studies of microbial communities in glacial lakes, especially in southeast Europe are rare and even neglected. It is well recognized that unexplored ecological niches and metabolic potential as well as new molecular frameworks of their microbial communities could be a gold mine of secondary metabolites with importance for biotechnology, medicine and pharmacy. Our goal was to assess the bacterial communities from selected Western Balkans glacial lakes. Selection of lakes was based on exposure to anthropological influences. Thus we analyzed bacterial communities from Plav lake (designated as D in the project, located in the town of Plav), Black lake (designated as C in the project, outside of human settlements but tourist attraction) and Donje Bare lake (isolated lake without significant human impact, designated as Z in the project).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Ice:Glacial lake

The aim was to identify the biodiversity differences in hypersaline brines; understanding the reasons of these differences, considering that brines might contain DNA and RNA molecules that remain trapped inside for long geological eras, thus representing a key to reconstruct past ecosystems.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Non-marine Saline and Alkaline:Hypersaline	31505750	Microbial Assemblages in Pressurized Antarctic Brine Pockets (Tarn Flat, Northern Victoria Land): A Hotspot of Biodiversity and Activity.	Two distinct pressurized hypersaline brine pockets (named TF4 and TF5), separated by a thin ice layer, were detected below an ice-sealed Antarctic lake. Prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) diversity, abundances (including virus-like particles) and metabolic profiles were investigated by an integrated approach, including traditional and new-generation methods. Although similar diversity indices were computed for both Bacteria and Archaea, distinct bacterial and archaeal assemblages were observed. Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria were more abundant in the shallowest brine pocket, TF4, and Deltaproteobacteria, mainly represented by versatile sulphate-reducing bacteria, dominated in the deepest, TF5. The detection of sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic Archaea likely reflects the presence of a distinct synthrophic consortium in TF5. Surprisingly, members assigned to hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were common to both brines, indicating that these cold habitats host the most thermally tolerant Archaea. The patterns of microbial communities were different, coherently with the observed microbiological diversity between TF4 and TF5 brines. Both the influence exerted by upward movement of saline brines from a sub-surface anoxic system and the possible occurrence of an ancient ice remnant from the Ross Ice Shelf were the likely main factors shaping the microbial communities.

MGYS00004249	How much do we know about marine metazoan biodiversity? Recent disclosures using second generation sequencing.	In response to contemporary threats to biodiversity, accurate and objective methods of species or operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assessment are fundamental to our understanding of mechanistic links among ecosystem components and resilience. Second generation sequencing approaches have been especially insightful for biodiversity analyses of the microbial biosphere, but to date, such approaches have not been used to study Metazoan phyla. Here, we utilize second generation sequencing for interpreting the relative richness of multiple metazoan phyla inhabiting the marine benthos. We identify (a.) comparative and substantial levels of unrecorded richness, that refute currently accepted paradigms of phylum rank abundance, (b.) ecosystem-level community composition at fine level spatial hierarchical scales and (c.) sequences derived from putative metazoan taxa that bear little genetic resemblance to any phylum that has been sequenced previously. These findings suggest that such techniques will provide a valuable addition to the exploratory tool-box for rapidly and simultaneously documenting the identity, composition and potential function of hitherto intractable, but ecologically important, communities.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Sediment	20981026	Second-generation environmental sequencing unmasks marine metazoan biodiversity.	Biodiversity is of crucial importance for ecosystem functioning, sustainability and resilience, but the magnitude and organization of marine diversity at a range of spatial and taxonomic scales are undefined. In this paper, we use second-generation sequencing to unmask putatively diverse marine metazoan biodiversity in a Scottish temperate benthic ecosystem. We show that remarkable differences in diversity occurred at microgeographical scales and refute currently accepted ecological and taxonomic paradigms of meiofaunal identity, rank abundance and concomitant understanding of trophic dynamics. Richness estimates from the current benchmarked Operational Clustering of Taxonomic Units from Parallel UltraSequencing analyses are broadly aligned with those derived from morphological assessments. However, the slope of taxon rarefaction curves for many phyla remains incomplete, suggesting that the true alpha diversity is likely to exceed current perceptions. The approaches provide a rapid, objective and cost-effective taxonomic framework for exploring links between ecosystem structure and function of all hitherto intractable, but ecologically important, communities.

MGYS00005420	Metagenomic sequences of the Ofunato Bay 2015	The Ofunato Bay in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, is a deep coastal bay located at the center of the Sanriku Rias coast and considered an economically and environmentally important asset. Here we present the first whole genome sequencing (WGS) study on the microbial communities of the Bay where surface water samples were collected in 2015 from three stations along its length to cover the entire bay. We sequenced 0.2-??m filter fraction, targeting the free-living fraction only, among the sequentially size-fractionated samples of 20.0-, 5.0-, 0.8- and 0.2-??m filters,. As expected, Proteobacteria (Alpha, Beta and Gamma) were the most abundant phyla in the Ofunato Bay followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Tenericutes. We detected a wide range of heterotrophic bacteria, Archaea and eukaryotic algae. The majority of these bacteria are considered significant in oceans and marine ecology.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal	29705129	Basin-scale seasonal changes in marine free-living bacterioplankton community in the Ofunato Bay.	The Ofunato Bay in the northeastern Pacific Ocean area of Japan possesses the highest biodiversity of marine organisms in the world and has attracted much attention due to its economic and environmental importance. We report here a shotgun metagenomic analysis of the year-round variation in free-living bacterioplankton collected across the entire length of the bay. Phylogenetic differences among spring, summer, autumn and winter bacterioplankton suggested that members of Proteobacteria tended to decrease at high water temperatures and increase at low temperatures. It was revealed that Candidatus Pelagibacter varied seasonally, reaching as much as 60% of all sequences at the genus level in the surface waters during winter. This increase was more evident in the deeper waters, where they reached up to 75%. The relative abundance of Planktomarina also rose during winter and fell during summer. A significant component of the winter bacterioplankton community was Archaea (mainly represented by Nitrosopumilus), as their relative abundance was very low during spring and summer but high during winter. In contrast, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria appeared to be higher in abundance during high-temperature periods. It was also revealed that Bacteroidetes constituted a significant component of the summer bacterioplankton community, being the second largest bacterial phylum detected in the Ofunato Bay. Its members, notably Polaribacter and Flavobacterium, were found to be high in abundance during spring and summer, particularly in the surface waters. Principal component analysis and hierarchal clustering analyses showed that the bacterial communities in the Ofunato Bay changed seasonally, likely caused by the levels of organic matter, which would be deeply mixed with surface runoff in the winter.

These datafiles include the 16S rRNA amplicon sequences of the bacterioplankton.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Marginal Sea	27148206	Spatio-Temporal Interdependence of Bacteria and Phytoplankton during a Baltic Sea Spring Bloom.	In temperate systems, phytoplankton spring blooms deplete inorganic nutrients and are major sources of organic matter for the microbial loop. In response to phytoplankton exudates and environmental factors, heterotrophic microbial communities are highly dynamic and change their abundance and composition both on spatial and temporal scales. Yet, most of our understanding about these processes comes from laboratory model organism studies, mesocosm experiments or single temporal transects. Spatial-temporal studies examining interactions of phytoplankton blooms and bacterioplankton community composition and function, though being highly informative, are scarce. In this study, pelagic microbial community dynamics (bacteria and phytoplankton) and environmental variables were monitored during a spring bloom across the Baltic Proper (two cruises between North Germany to Gulf of Finland). To test to what extent bacterioplankton community composition relates to the spring bloom, we used next generation amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, phytoplankton diversity analysis based on microscopy counts and population genotyping of the dominating diatom Skeletonema marinoi. Several phytoplankton bloom related and environmental variables were identified to influence bacterial community composition. Members of Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial community composition but the bacterial groups showed no apparent correlation with direct bloom related variables. The less abundant bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia, on the other hand, were strongly associated with phytoplankton biomass, diatom:dinoflagellate ratio, and colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM). Many bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed high niche specificities. For example, particular Bacteroidetes OTUs were associated with two distinct genetic clusters of S. marinoi. Our study revealed the complexity of interactions of bacterial taxa with inter- and intraspecific genetic variation in phytoplankton. Overall, our findings imply that biotic and abiotic factors during spring bloom influence bacterial community dynamics in a hierarchical manner.

Large-scale high-throughput sequencing techniques are rapidly becoming popular methods to profile complex communities and have generated deep insights into community biodiversity. However, several technical problems, especially sequencing artifacts such as nucleotide calling errors, could artificially inflate biodiversity estimates. Sequence filtering for artifact removal is a conventional method for deleting error-prone sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. As rare species represented by low-abundance sequences in datasets may be sensitive to artifact removal process, the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery has not been well evaluated in natural complex communities. Here we employed both internal (reliable operational taxonomic units selected from communities themselves) and external (indicator species spiked into communities) references to evaluate the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery using 454 pyrosequencing of complex plankton communities collected from both freshwater and marine habitats. Multiple analyses revealed three clear patterns: 1) rare species were eliminated during sequence filtering process at all tested filtering stringencies, 2) more rare taxa were eliminated as filtering stringencies increased, and 3) elimination of rare species intensified as biomass of a species in a community was reduced. Our results suggest that cautions be applied when processing high-throughput sequencing data, especially for rare taxa detection for conservation of species at risk and for rapid response programs targeting non-indigenous species. Establishment of both internal and external references proposed here provides a practical strategy to evaluate artifact removal process.

Bacteria, archaea and fungi play crucial roles in wetland biogeochemical processes. However, little is known about their community structure, dynamics and interactions in subtropical coastal wetlands. Here, we examined communities of the three kingdoms in mangrove and mudflat sediments of a subtropical coastal wetland using Ion Torrent amplicon sequencing and co-occurrence network analysis. Bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities comprised mainly of members from the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, Bathyarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, and Ascomycota, respectively. Species richness and Shannon diversity were highest in bacteria, followed by archaea and were lowest in fungi. Distinct spatiotemporal patterns were observed, with bacterial and fungal communities varying, to different extent, between wet and dry seasons and between mangrove and mudflat, and archaeal community remaining relatively stable between seasons and regions. Redundancy analysis revealed temperature as the major driver of the seasonal patterns of bacterial and fungal communities but also highlighted the importance of interkingdom biotic factors in shaping the community structure of all three kingdoms. Potential ecological interactions and putative keystone taxa were identified based on co-occurrence network analysis. These findings facilitate current understanding of the microbial ecology of subtropical coastal wetlands and provide a basis for better modelling of ecological processes in this important ecosystem.

Variation in microbial species diversity has typically been explained as the outcome of local ecological factors driving species coexistence, overlooking the roles of evolutionary constraints. Here, we argue that macro-evolutionary niche conservatism and unequal diversification rates among phylum-level lineages are strong determinants of diversity-environment relationships in bacterial systems. That is, apart from stochasticity, environmental effects operate most strongly on phylum composition, which in turn dictates the species diversity of bacterial communities. This concept is demonstrated using bacterioplankton in the surface seawaters of the East China Sea. Furthermore, we show that the species richness of a local bacterioplankton community can generally be estimated based on the relative abundances of phyla and their contributions of species numbers in the global seawater pool-highlighting the important influence of evolutionary constraints on local community diversity.

MGYS00003863	Rio de Janeiro Coastline	Although Brazil is well known for the great biodiversity within its flora and fauna, the microbial diversity has been poorly characterized. The geographic formation of Rio de Janeiro results in a combination of distinct environments near the coastal Atlantic Ocean, such as Atlantic rain forest, restingas, estuaries, bay areas, hypersaline lagoons and freshwater lakes. All together make the surrounding areas of Rio de Janeiro coastline a microbial diversity hotspot. These tropical regions are of enormous interest since they are considered an important source of novel and unique microorganisms for bioremediation and for biotechnological industries. However, the adjacent areas present either a deficient sewage treatment or/and a busy industrial park that can severely impact the environment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize the microbial community and the functional diversity from pristine and contaminated aquatic environments from Rio de Janeiro coastline. Studying the microbial and functional distributions associated with environmental data, we will be able to identify the effect of environmental factors on the microbial community. This information will be useful to preserve the natural conditions of these tropical areas.	root:Environmental:Aquatic	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

Contemporary in-depth sequencing of environmental samples has provided novel insights into microbial community structures, revealing that their diversity had been previously underestimated. Communities in marine environments are commonly composed of a few dominant taxa and a high number of taxonomically diverse, low-abundance organisms. However, studying the roles and genomic information of these "rare" organisms remains challenging, because little is known about their ecological niches and the environmental conditions to which they respond. Given the current threat to coral reef ecosystems, we investigated the potential of corals to provide highly specialized habitats for bacterial taxa including those that are rarely detected or absent in surrounding reef waters. The analysis of more than 350,000 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequence tags and almost 2,000 nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that rare seawater biosphere members are highly abundant or even dominant in diverse Caribbean corals. Closely related corals (in the same genus/family) harbored similar bacterial communities. At higher taxonomic levels, however, the similarities of these communities did not correlate with the phylogenetic relationships among corals, opening novel questions about the evolutionary stability of coral-microbial associations. Large proportions of OTUs (28.7-49.1%) were unique to the coral species of origin. Analysis of the most dominant ribotypes suggests that many uncovered bacterial taxa exist in coral habitats and await future exploration. Our results indicate that coral species, and by extension other animal hosts, act as specialized habitats of otherwise rare microbes in marine ecosystems. Here, deep sequencing provided insights into coral microbiota at an unparalleled resolution and revealed that corals harbor many bacterial taxa previously not known. Given that two of the coral species investigated are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, our results add an important microbial diversity-based perspective to the significance of conserving coral reefs.																																													
MGYS00004550	Metagenomics of Ojo de Campo	Water samples from Ojo de Campo Lake were sequenced and analyzed	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Non-marine Saline and Alkaline:Hypersaline	32655530	First Report on the Plasmidome From a High-Altitude Lake of the Andean Puna.	Mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, drive the evolution of prokaryotic genomes through the horizontal transfer of genes allowing genetic exchange between bacteria. Moreover, plasmids carry accessory genes, which encode functions that may offer an advantage to the host. Thus, it is expected that in a certain ecological niche, plasmids are enriched in accessory functions, which are important for their hosts to proliferate in that niche. Puquio de Campo Naranja is a high-altitude lake from the Andean Puna exposed to multiple extreme conditions, including high UV radiation, alkalinity, high concentrations of arsenic, heavy metals, dissolved salts, high thermal amplitude and low O<sub>2</sub> pressure. Microorganisms living in this lake need to develop efficient mechanisms and strategies to cope under these conditions. The aim of this study was to characterize the plasmidome of microbialites from Puquio de Campo Naranja, and identify potential hosts and encoded functions using a deep-sequencing approach. The potential ecological impact of the plasmidome, including plasmids from cultivable and non-cultivable microorganisms, is described for the first time in a lake representing an extreme environment of the Puna. This study showed that the recovered genetic information for the plasmidome was novel in comparison to the metagenome derived from the same environment. The study of the total plasmid population allowed the identification of genetic features typically encoded by plasmids, such as resistance and virulence factors. The resistance genes comprised resistances to heavy metals, antibiotics and stress factors. These results highlight the key role of plasmids for their hosts and impact of extrachromosomal elements to thrive in a certain ecological niche.																																													
MGYS00004654	A comparison of eukaryote community composition in four contrasting sediments in the Celtic Sea	As part of the NERC funded Shelf Seas Biogeochemistry program, microbial structure, diversity and abundance was compared in four contrasting sediment types, from mud to sand. Samples were collected before (March 2015) and immediately after a spring diatom bloom (May) and also again in late summer (August). These data are 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequence sets from the four sediment types, and from the three sampling time points. Relative abundance and composition was determined using Illumina MiSeq (MrDNA, TX, USA). The V1V3 region of 16S rRNA was amplified using the PCR primers 27F (Vergin et al., 1998) and 519Rmod (Andreotti et al., 2011) using the PCR and sequencing conditions described in Tait et al. (2015). For 18S rRNA genes, the primers Euk7F and Euk570R were used.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

MGYS00005705	marine metagenome Metagenome	Marine plastic debris has become a significant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide. Little is known however, about its influence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the 'Great Pacific garbage patch'. The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2-5 mm and > 5 mm) ranged from 0.35-3.7 particles m-3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Pacific Ocean. Net community oxygen production (NCP = gross primary production  community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas NCP in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa, and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from surrounding picoplankton, and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with significantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes and nifH genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions and nitrogen fixation. In aggregate, our findings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from free-living planktonic microbial communities.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	27822538	Diversity and Activity of Communities Inhabiting Plastic Debris in the North Pacific Gyre.

While the negative impacts of plastic debris on oceanic macrobiota, including mammals and birds, are well documented, little is known about its influence on smaller marine residents, including microbes that have key roles in ocean biogeochemistry. Our work provides a new perspective on microbial communities inhabiting microplastics that includes its effect on microbial biogeochemical activities and a description of the cross-domain communities inhabiting plastic particles. This study is among the first molecular ecology, plastic debris biota surveys in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. It has identified fundamental differences in the functional potential and taxonomic composition of plastic-associated microbes versus planktonic microbes found in the surrounding open-ocean habitat. <b>Author Video</b>: An author video summary of this article is available.

Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc. (JOI), a group of 18 U.S. institutions, was the Program Manager. Texas A&amp;M University, College of Geosciences was the Science Operator. Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory provided Logging Services and administered the Site Survey Data Bank. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in these documents are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation, the participating agencies, Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc., Texas A&amp;M University, or Texas A&amp;M Research Foundation.Studies of deeply buried, sedimentary microbial communities and associated biogeochemical processes during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 201 showed elevated prokaryotic cell numbers in sediment layers where methane is consumed anaerobically at the expense of sulfate. Here, we show that extractable archaeal rRNA, selecting only for active community members in these ecosystems, is dominated by sequences of uncultivated Archaea affiliated with the Marine Benthic Group B and the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group, whereas known methanotrophic Archaea are not detectable. Carbon flow reconstructions based on stable isotopic compositions of whole archaeal cells, intact archaeal membrane lipids, and other sedimentary carbon pools indicate that these Archaea assimilate sedimentary organic compounds other than methane even though methanotrophy accounts for a major fraction of carbon cycled in these ecosystems. Oxidation of methane by members of Marine Benthic Group B and the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group without assimilation of methane carbon provides a plausible explanation. Maintenance energies of these subsurface communities appear to be orders of magnitude lower than minimum values known from laboratory observations, and ecosystem-level carbon budgets suggest that community turnover times are on the order of 100 to 2,000 years. Our study provides clues about the metabolic functionality of two cosmopolitan groups of uncultured Archaea.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Sediment	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

Viruses infecting microorganisms are ubiquitous and abundant in the ocean. However, it is unclear when and where the numerous viral particles we observe in the sea are produced and whether they are active. To address these questions, we performed time-series analyses of viral metagenomes and microbial metatranscriptomes collected over a period of 24 h at a Japanese coastal site. Through mapping the metatranscriptomic reads on three sets of viral genomes ((i) 878 contigs of Osaka Bay viromes (OBV), (ii) 1766 environmental viral genomes from marine viromes, and (iii) 2429 reference viral genomes), we revealed that all the local OBV contigs were transcribed in the host fraction. This indicates that the majority of viral populations detected in viromes are active, and suggests that virions are rapidly diluted as a result of diffusion, currents, and mixing. Our data further revealed a peak of cyanophage gene expression in the afternoon/dusk followed by an increase of genomes from their virions at night and less-coherent infectious patterns for viruses putatively infecting various groups of heterotrophs. This suggests that cyanophages drive the diel release of cyanobacteria-derived organic matter into the environment and viruses of heterotrophic bacteria might have adapted to the population-specific life cycles of hosts.

The thinner sea-ice regime that the Arctic has been facing changed Arctics primary productivity and biogeochemistry. Understand the dynamics of the microbial communities that feed Arctic phytoplankton and biologically derived carbon export will be worthwhile in order to draw future trends. In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeographic patters of Arctic microbiome diversity and distribution along two oceanographic transects in the Marginal Ice Zone around Svalbard, within strong environmental gradients (Ripfjorden, Kongsfjorden). A total of 11 stations were sample at three depths (surface, chlorophyll maximum and bottom) during the Norwegian Polar Institute MOSJ-ICE 2016 plankton-monitoring program. Samples were concentrated on board through Sterivex 0.2 mm filtration and preserved at -80oC for later DNA extraction. Amplification of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were performed and sequenced in Illumina MiSeq with a sequence depth of about 100 thousand readpairs. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic MOSJ-ICE16 data sets collection comprises highly complex and diverse microbial communities with a marked biogeographic pattern of distribution. Strong links were identified between bacterioplanckton and phytoplankton/picophytoplankton distribution driven by environmental and biogeochemical forces, most relevant to unravel the role of microbial pathways in supporting Arctic Ocean Primary productivity and system integrity.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic

MGYS00004562	Methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria are major contributors to mercury methylation in boreal lake sediments	Methylmercury is a potent human neurotoxin easily biomagnified in aquatic food webs. Anaerobic microorganisms containing the hgcA gene potentially mediate the formation of methylmercury in natural environments, but the diversity of microbial mercury methylating communities in the environment remains largely unexplored. The diversity of mercury methylating microbial communities in boreal lake sediments, encompassing a wide range of mercury methylation rates, was characterized using barcoded amplification and high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and hgcA genes. Previously, most studies in aquatic ecosystems have implicated sulphate-reducing bacteria as the main mercury methylators. Here we demonstrate that Methanomicrobiales contribute significantly to the hgcA gene pool in boreal lake sediments. Experimental mercury isotope tracer incubations confirmed that, while sulphate-reducers contribute to mercury methylation, methanogens and iron reducers are also quantitatively important for the process. Our results change the way we perceive the local and global diversity of mercury methylating microbial communities in boreal lake sediments and call for further studies on the environmental factors regulating mercury methylation.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lentic:Sediment	30242005	Methanogens and Iron-Reducing Bacteria: the Overlooked Members of Mercury-Methylating Microbial Communities in Boreal Lakes.	Methylmercury is a potent human neurotoxin which biomagnifies in aquatic food webs. Although anaerobic microorganisms containing the <i>hgcA</i> gene potentially mediate the formation of methylmercury in natural environments, the diversity of these mercury-methylating microbial communities remains largely unexplored. Previous studies have implicated sulfate-reducing bacteria as the main mercury methylators in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, we characterized the diversity of mercury-methylating microbial communities of boreal lake sediments using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and <i>hgcA</i> genes. Our results show that in the lake sediments, <i>Methanomicrobiales</i> and <i>Geobacteraceae</i> also represent abundant members of the mercury-methylating communities. In fact, incubation experiments with a mercury isotopic tracer and molybdate revealed that only between 38% and 45% of mercury methylation was attributed to sulfate reduction. These results suggest that methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria may contribute to more than half of the mercury methylation in boreal lakes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Despite the global awareness that mercury, and methylmercury in particular, is a neurotoxin to which millions of people continue to be exposed, there are sizable gaps in the understanding of the processes and organisms involved in methylmercury formation in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, we shed light on the diversity of the microorganisms responsible for methylmercury formation in boreal lake sediments. All the microorganisms identified are associated with the processing of organic matter in aquatic systems. Moreover, our results show that the well-known mercury-methylating sulfate-reducing bacteria constituted only a minor portion of the potential mercury methylators. In contrast, methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria were important contributors to methylmercury formation, highlighting their role in mercury cycling in the environment.

Despite representing one of the largest biomes on earth, biodiversity of the deep seafloor is still poorly known. Environmental DNA metabarcoding offers prospects for fast inventories and surveys, yet requires standardized sampling approaches and careful choice of environmental substrate. Here, we aimed to optimize the genetic assessment of prokaryote (16S), protistan (18S V4), and metazoan (18S V1-V2, COI) communities, by evaluating sampling strategies for sediment and aboveground water, deployed simultaneously at one deep-sea site. For sediment, while size-class sorting through sieving had no significant effect on total detected alpha diversity and resolved similar taxonomic compositions at the phylum level for all markers studied, it effectively increased the detection of meiofauna phyla. For water, large volumes obtained from an in situ pump (~ 6000 L) detected significantly more metazoan diversity than 7.5 L collected in sampling boxes. However, the pump being limited by larger mesh sizes (&gt; 20 mym), only captured a fraction of microbial diversity, while sampling boxes allowed access to the pico- and nanoplankton. More importantly, communities characterized by aboveground water samples significantly differed from those characterized by sediment, whatever volume used, and both sample types only shared between 3 and 8% of molecular units. Together, these results underline that sediment sieving may be recommended when targeting metazoans, and aboveground water does not represent an alternative to sediment sampling for inventories of benthic diversity.

This field study was conducted in the North Pacific Line-67 in October 2009 to examine phytoplankton community diversity.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	28073013	Newly discovered deep-branching marine plastid lineages are numerically rare but globally distributed.	Ocean surface warming is resulting in an expansion of stratified, low-nutrient environments, a process referred to as ocean desertification [1]. A challenge for assessing the impact of these changes is the lack of robust baseline information on the biological communities that carry out marine photosynthesis. Phytoplankton perform half of global biological CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, fuel marine food chains, and include diverse eukaryotic algae that have photosynthetic organelles (plastids) acquired through multiple evolutionary events [1-3]. While amassing data from ocean ecosystems for the Baselines Initiative (6,177 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and 9.4 million high-quality 16S V1-V2 amplicons) we identified two deep-branching plastid lineages based on 16S rRNA gene data. The two lineages have global distributions, but do not correspond to known phytoplankton. How the newly discovered phytoplankton lineages contribute to food chains and vertical carbon export to the deep sea remains unknown, but their prevalence in expanding, low nutrient surface waters suggests they will have a role in future oceans.

Microbial mat communities are associated with extensive (~700 km<sup>2</sup>) and morphologically variable carbonate structures, termed microbialites, in the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. However, whether the composition of GSL mat communities covaries with microbialite morphology and lake environment is unknown. Moreover, the potential adaptations that allow the establishment of these extensive mat communities at high salinity (14% to 17% total salts) are poorly understood. To address these questions, microbial mats were sampled from seven locations in the south arm of GSL representing different lake environments and microbialite morphologies. Despite the morphological differences, microbialite-associated mats were taxonomically similar and were dominated by the cyanobacterium <i>Euhalothece</i> and several heterotrophic bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing of a representative mat revealed <i>Euhalothece</i> and subdominant <i>Thiohalocapsa</i> populations that harbor the Calvin cycle and nitrogenase, suggesting they supply fixed carbon and nitrogen to heterotrophic bacteria. Fifteen of the next sixteen most abundant taxa are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs and, surprisingly, harbor reaction center, rhodopsin, and/or bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis proteins, suggesting aerobic photoheterotrophic (APH) capabilities. Importantly, proteins involved in APH are enriched in the GSL community relative to that in microbialite mat communities from lower salinity environments. These findings indicate that the ability to integrate light into energy metabolism is a key adaptation allowing for robust mat development in the hypersaline GSL.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The earliest evidence of life on Earth is from organosedimentary structures, termed microbialites, preserved in 3.481-billion-year-old (Ga) rocks. Phototrophic microbial mats form in association with an ~700-km<sup>2</sup> expanse of morphologically diverse microbialites in the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. Here, we show taxonomically similar microbial mat communities are associated with morphologically diverse microbialites across the lake. Metagenomic sequencing reveals an abundance and diversity of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa capable of harvesting light energy to drive metabolism. The unexpected abundance of and diversity in the mechanisms of harvesting light energy observed in GSL mat populations likely function to minimize niche overlap among coinhabiting taxa, provide a mechanism(s) to increase energy yield and osmotic balance during salt stress, and enhance fitness. Together, these physiological benefits promote the formation of robust mats that, in turn, influence the formation of morphologically diverse microbialite structures that can be imprinted in the rock record.	28432307	Arsenic metabolism in high altitude modern stromatolites revealed by metagenomic analysis.	Modern stromatolites thrive only in selected locations in the world. Socompa Lake, located in the Andean plateau at 3570 masl, is one of the numerous extreme Andean microbial ecosystems described over recent years. Extreme environmental conditions include hypersalinity, high UV incidence, and high arsenic content, among others. After Socompa's stromatolite microbial communities were analysed by metagenomic DNA sequencing, taxonomic classification showed dominance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and a remarkably high number of unclassified sequences. A functional analysis indicated that carbon fixation might occur not only by the Calvin-Benson cycle, but also through alternative pathways such as the reverse TCA cycle, and the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Deltaproteobacteria were involved both in sulfate reduction and nitrogen fixation. Significant differences were found when comparing the Socompa stromatolite metagenome to the Shark Bay (Australia) smooth mat metagenome: namely, those involving stress related processes, particularly, arsenic resistance. An in-depth analysis revealed a surprisingly diverse metabolism comprising all known types of As resistance and energy generating pathways. While the ars operon was the main mechanism, an important abundance of arsM genes was observed in selected phyla. The data resulting from this work will prove a cornerstone for further studies on this rare microbial community.

Subseafloor sediments accumulate large amounts of organic and inorganic materials that contain a highly diverse microbial ecosystem. The aim of this study was to survey the bacterial community of subseafloor sediments from the South China Sea. Pyrosequencing of over 265,000 amplicons of the V3 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was performed on 16 sediment samples collected from multiple locations in the northern region of the South China Sea from depths ranging from 35 to 4000 m. A total of 9,726 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; between 695 and 2819 unique OTUs per sample) at 97% sequence similarity level were generated. In total, 40 bacterial phyla including 22 formally described phyla and 18 candidate phyla, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi being most diverse, were identified. The most abundant phylotype, accounting for 42.6% of all sequences, belonged to Gammaproteobacteria, which possessed absolute predominance in the samples analyzed. Among the 18 candidate phyla, 12 were found for the first time in the South China Sea. This study provided a novel insight into the composition of bacterial communities of the South China Sea subseafloor. Furthermore, abundances and community similarity analysis showed that the compositions of the bacterial communities are very similar at phylum level at different depths from 35-4000 m.

Sediment microbial communities from plain river networks exert different effects on pollutant transformation and migration in lake basins. In this study, we examined millions of Illumina reads (16S rRNA gene amplicons) to compare lake, lake wetland, and estuary bacterial communities through a technically consistent approach. Results showed that bacterial communities in the sampled lake sediments had the highest alpha-diversity (Group B), than in sampled lake wetland sediments and estuary sediments. Proteobacteria was the most abundant (more than 30%) phyla in all the sediments. The lake sediments had more Nitrospirae (1.63%-11.75%) and Acidobacteria (3.46%-10.21%) than the lake wetland and estuary sediments, and estuary sediments had a greater abundance of the phylum Firmicutes (mean of 22.30%). Statistical analysis (LEfSe) revealed that lake wetland sediments contained greater abundances of the class Anaerolineaceae, orders Xanthomonadales, Pseudomonadales, and genera Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter. The lake sediments had a distinct community of diverse primary producers, such as phylum Acidobacteria, order Ignavibacteriales, and families Nitrospiraceae, Hydrogenophilaceae. Total phosphorus and organic matter were the main factors influencing the bacterial communities in sediments from several parts of the lake wetland and river estuary (p &lt; .05). The novel insights into basin pollution control in plain river networks may be obtained from microbial distribution in sediments from different basin regions.

The importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning across trophic levels, especially via predatory-prey interactions, is receiving increased recognition. However, this topic has rarely been explored for marine microbes, even though microbial biodiversity contributes significantly to marine ecosystem function and energy flows. Here we examined diversity and biomass of bacteria (prey) and nanoflagellates (predators), as well as their effects on trophic transfer efficiency in the East China Sea. Specifically, we investigated: (i) predator diversity effects on prey biomass and trophic transfer efficiency (using the biomass ratio of predator/prey as a proxy), (ii) prey diversity effects on predator biomass and trophic transfer efficiency, and (iii) the relationship between predator and prey diversity. We found higher prey diversity enhanced both diversity and biomass of predators, as well as trophic transfer efficiency, which may arise from more balanced diet and/or enhanced niche complementarity owing to higher prey diversity. By contrast, no clear effect was detected for predator diversity on prey biomass and transfer efficiency. Notably, we found prey diversity effects on predator-prey interactions; whereas, we found no significant diversity effect on biomass within the same trophic level. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multi-trophic biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in natural ecosystems.

Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse habitats on Earth, but knowledge of their associated marinemicrobiome remains limited. To increase the understanding of the coral reef ecosystem in the lower Gulf of Thailand, this study utilized 16S and 18S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing to identify the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiota present in the reef water at Kham Island, Trat province, Thailand (N6.97 E100.86). The obtained result was then compared with the published microbiota from different coral reef water and marine sites. The coral reefs at Kham Island are of the fringe type. The reefs remain preserved and abundant. The community similarity indices (i.e., Lennon similarity index, Yue &amp; Clayton similarity index) indicated that the prokaryotic composition of Kham was closely related to that of Kra, another fringing reef site in the lower Gulf of Thailand, followed by coral reef water microbiota at GS048b (Cooks Bay, Fr. Polynesia), Palmyra (Northern Line Islands, United States) and GS108b (Coccos Keeling, Australia), respectively. Additionally, the microbial eukaryotic populations at Kham was analyzed and compared with the available database at Kra. Both eukaryotic microbiota, in summer and winter seasons, were correlated. An abundance of <i>Dinophysis acuminata</i> was noted in the summer season, in accordance with its reported cause of diarrhoeatic shellfish outbreak in the summer season elsewhere. The slightly lower biodiversity in Kham than at Kra might reflect the partly habitat difference due to coastal anthropogenic activities and minor water circulation, as Kham locates close to the mainland and is surrounded by islands (e.g., Chang and Kut islands). The global marine microbiota comparison suggested relatively similar microbial structures among coral sites irrespective of geographical location, supporting the importance of coral-associated marine microbiomes, and Spearman's correlation analysis between community membership and factors of shore distance and seawater temperature indicated potential correlation of these factors (<i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.05) with Kham, Kra, and some other coral and coastal sites. Together, this study provided the second marine microbial database for the coral reef of the lower Gulf of Thailand, and a comparison of the coral-associated marine microbial diversity among global ocean sites.

The benthic boundary layer (BBL) is the part of the water column that is situated near to the sediment surface, where active oceanic biogeochemical cycling occurs. Archaea play an important role in mediating this cycling, however, their composition and diversity in the BBL remain largely unknown. We investigated the community composition and abundance of both particle-attached (PA) and free-living (FL) archaea in the BBL on the slopes of the Mariana Trench using Illumina sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR), at both the DNA and RNA levels. Our results showed that Thaumarchaeota (&gt;90%) and Woesearchaeota (1-10%) dominated in all the BBL samples, and that the former was composed mainly of Marine Group I (MGI). A clear separation of PA and FL samples was observed, and they showed a high level of similarity to the subsurface sediments and the water column, respectively. No significant differences were detected in the archaeal communities located in the southern and northern slopes of the Mariana Trench, or between the levels of DNA and RNA. However, lower RNA/DNA ratios (estimated by qPCR) were found in the PA samples than in the FL samples, indicating higher transcriptional activities in the FL fractions. A distinct archaeal community structure was found in the middle of the trench when compared with samples collected at the same depth at other stations along the trench slopes. This indicates that a dynamic deep current might affect the distribution of organic matter on the slopes. Our study provides direct information regarding the archaeal communities in the BBL of the Mariana Trench. We suggest that this might promote further exploration of the ecological roles and microbial processes of such communities located in deep-sea ecosystems.																																													
MGYS00004488	Temporal effect of plant diversity and oiling on nitrogen cycling in marsh sediments	The effect of plant diversity on ecosystem recovery from oil spills and temporal effects on biogeochemical cycles needs to be investigated to identify key ecosystem processes as well as the various challenges associated with coastal ecosystem recovery. Oil spill effects on nitrogen cycling caused by either changes in species composition of primary producers or microbial community composition have also been documented. Although low to moderate oiling of coastal wetlands has been shown to impact ecosystem functions, studies focused on determining long term impacts of oil spills on marsh vegetation, microbial community composition and associated effects on nitrogen cycling are relatively limited. This project investigated temporal effects of plant diversity on denitrification and microbial community dynamics through mesocosm experiments. The mesocosms consisted of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, along with either a monoculture or polyculture of the smooth cord grass, Spartina alterniflora. The results presented were obtained using DNA extracted from replicate sediment cores sampled in April 2016, 6 months after the mesocosms were treated with oil to achieve a final concentration of 4000 ppm.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Wetlands:Marsh

MGYS00005265	Symbiodinium ITS2 Arabian Seas	Next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 marker gene was used to assess Symbiodinium community composition and diversity comprising 892 samples from 46 hard and soft coral genera.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Coral reef	29192903	Rare symbionts may contribute to the resilience of coral-algal assemblages.	The association between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) is the key to the success of reef ecosystems in highly oligotrophic environments, but it is also their Achilles' heel due to its vulnerability to local stressors and the effects of climate change. Research during the last two decades has shaped a view that coral host-Symbiodinium pairings are diverse, but largely exclusive. Deep sequencing has now revealed the existence of a rare diversity of cryptic Symbiodinium assemblages within the coral holobiont, in addition to one or a few abundant algal members. While the contribution of the most abundant resident Symbiodinium species to coral physiology is widely recognized, the significance of the rare and low abundant background Symbiodinium remains a matter of debate. In this study, we assessed how coral-Symbiodinium communities assemble and how rare and abundant components together constitute the Symbiodinium community by analyzing 892 coral samples comprising &gt;110 000 unique Symbiodinium ITS2 marker gene sequences. Using network modeling, we show that host-Symbiodinium communities assemble in non-random 'clusters' of abundant and rare symbionts. Symbiodinium community structure follows the same principles as bacterial communities, for which the functional significance of rare members (the 'rare bacterial biosphere') has long been recognized. Importantly, the inclusion of rare Symbiodinium taxa in robustness analyses revealed a significant contribution to the stability of the host-symbiont community overall. As such, it highlights the potential functions rare symbionts may provide to environmental resilience of the coral holobiont.	28286360	Biogeography and molecular diversity of coral symbionts in the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> around the Arabian Peninsula.	Coral reefs rely on the symbiosis between scleractinian corals and intracellular, photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> making the assessment of symbiont diversity critical to our understanding of ecological resilience of these ecosystems. This study characterizes <i>Symbiodinium</i> diversity around the Arabian Peninsula, which contains some of the most thermally diverse and understudied reefs on Earth. Shallow water coral reefs throughout the Red Sea (RS), Sea of Oman (SO), and Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG). Next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 marker gene was used to assess <i>Symbiodinium</i> community composition and diversity comprising 892 samples from 46 hard and soft coral genera. Corals were associated with a large diversity of <i>Symbiodinium</i>, which usually consisted of one or two prevalent symbiont types and many types at low abundance. <i>Symbiodinium</i> communities were strongly structured according to geographical region and to a lesser extent by coral host identity. Overall symbiont communities were composed primarily of species from clade A and C in the RS, clade A, C, and D in the SO, and clade C and D in the PAG, representing a gradual shift from C- to D-dominated coral hosts. The analysis of symbiont diversity in an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)-based framework allowed the identification of differences in symbiont taxon richness over geographical regions and host genera. Our study represents a comprehensive overview over biogeography and molecular diversity of <i>Symbiodinium</i> in the Arabian Seas, where coral reefs thrive in one of the most extreme environmental settings on the planet. As such our data will serve as a baseline for further exploration into the effects of environmental change on host-symbiont pairings and the identification and ecological significance of <i>Symbiodinium</i> types from regions already experiencing 'Future Ocean' conditions.																																										
MGYS00003810	Diversity of carbonate deposits and basement rocks in continental and marine serpentinite seeps.	Biogeography of serpentinite-hosted microbial communities Microbial habitats hosted in ultramafic rocks constitute substantial, globally-distributed portions of the subsurface biosphere, occurring both on the continents and beneath the seafloor. The aqueous alteration of ultramafics, in a process known as serpentinization, creates energy rich, high pH conditions, with low concentrations of inorganic carbon which place fundamental constraints upon microbial metabolism and physiology. Despite their importance, very few studies have attempted to directly access and quantify microbial activities and distributions in the serpentinite-hosted ecosystems. We have initiated microbiological studies of alkaline springs and their associated carbonate deposits at three separate continental sites of serpentinization in Newfoundland, Italy, and California, and we are comparing these results to previous analyses of the Lost City hydrothermal field, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We anticipate that the data from these samples will yield insight into the biogeography of serpentinite-hosted microbial communities and provide targets for further investigation of important biogeochemical processes.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Sediment	22232619	Metagenomic evidence for h(2) oxidation and h(2) production by serpentinite-hosted subsurface microbial communities.	Ultramafic rocks in the Earth's mantle represent a tremendous reservoir of carbon and reducing power. Upon tectonic uplift and exposure to fluid flow, serpentinization of these materials generates copious energy, sustains abiogenic synthesis of organic molecules, and releases hydrogen gas (H(2)). In order to assess the potential for microbial H(2) utilization fueled by serpentinization, we conducted metagenomic surveys of a marine serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal chimney (at the Lost City hydrothermal field) and two continental serpentinite-hosted alkaline seeps (at the Tablelands Ophiolite, Newfoundland). Novel [NiFe]-hydrogenase sequences were identified at both the marine and continental sites, and in both cases, phylogenetic analyses indicated aerobic, potentially autotrophic Betaproteobacteria belonging to order Burkholderiales as the most likely H(2)-oxidizers. Both sites also yielded metagenomic evidence for microbial H(2) production catalyzed by [FeFe]-hydrogenases in anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria belonging to order Clostridiales. In addition, we present metagenomic evidence at both sites for aerobic carbon monoxide utilization and anaerobic carbon fixation via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. In general, our results point to H(2)-oxidizing Betaproteobacteria thriving in shallow, oxic-anoxic transition zones and the anaerobic Clostridia thriving in anoxic, deep subsurface habitats. These data demonstrate the feasibility of metagenomic investigations into novel subsurface habitats via surface-exposed seeps and indicate the potential for H(2)-powered primary production in serpentinite-hosted subsurface habitats.

Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which can preserve the signatures of present and past infections.

Salt marshes provide many key ecosystem services that have tremendous ecological and economic value. One critical service is the removal of fixed nitrogen from coastal waters, which limits the negative effects of eutrophication resulting from increased nutrient supply. Nutrient enrichment of salt marsh sediments results in higher rates of nitrogen cycling and, commonly, a concurrent increase in the flux of nitrous oxide, an important greenhouse gas. Little is known, however, regarding controls on the microbial communities that contribute to nitrous oxide fluxes in marsh sediments. To address this disconnect, we generated profiles of microbial communities and communities of micro-organisms containing specific nitrogen cycling genes that encode several enzymes (<i>amoA, norB, nosZ)</i> related to nitrous oxide flux from salt marsh sediments. We hypothesized that communities of microbes responsible for nitrogen transformations will be structured by nitrogen availability. Taxa that respond positively to high nitrogen inputs may be responsible for the elevated rates of nitrogen cycling processes measured in fertilized sediments. Our data show that, with the exception of ammonia-oxidizing archaea, the community composition of organisms involved in the production and consumption of nitrous oxide was altered under nutrient enrichment. These results suggest that previously measured rates of nitrous oxide production and consumption are likely the result of changes in community structure, not simply changes in microbial activity.

The dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), human pathogenic bacteria (HPB), and antibiotic-resistant HPB (ARHPB) from animal feedlot to nearby environment poses a potentially high risk to environmental ecology and public health. Here, a metagenomic analysis was employed to explore the dissemination of ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from a pig feedlot to surrounding stream and agricultural soils. In total, not detectable (ND)-1,628.4 myg/kg of antibiotic residues, 18 types of ARGs, 48 HPB species, and 216 ARB isolates were detected in all samples. Antibiotic residues from pig feedlot mainly migrated into stream sediments and greenhouse soil. The dominant ARGs and HPB species from pig feedlot spread into stream sediments (tetracycline resistance genes, Clostridium difficile, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), stream water (multidrug resistance (MDR) genes, Shigella flexneri, and Bordetella pertussis), and greenhouse soil (MDR genes, Bacillus anthracis, and Brucella melitensis). It is concerning that 54.4% of 216 ARB isolates from all samples were potential ARHPB species, and genome sequencing and functional annotation of 4 MDR HPB isolates showed 9 ARG types. Our findings revealed the potential migration and dissemination of antibiotic residues, ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from pig feedlot to surrounding stream and agricultural soils via pig sewage discharge and manure fertilization.

The deep sedimentary biosphere, extending 100s of meters below the seafloor harbors unexpected diversity of Bacteria, Archaea, and microbial eukaryotes. Far less is known about microbial eukaryotes in subsurface habitats, albeit several studies have indicated that fungi dominate microbial eukaryotic communities and fungal molecular signatures (of both yeasts and filamentous forms) have been detected in samples as deep as 1740 mbsf. Here, we compare and contrast fungal ribosomal RNA gene signatures and whole community metatranscriptomes present in sediment core samples from 6 and 95 mbsf from Peru Margin site 1229A and from samples from 12 and 345 mbsf from Canterbury Basin site U1352. The metatranscriptome analyses reveal higher relative expression of amino acid and peptide transporters in the less nutrient rich Canterbury Basin sediments compared to the nutrient rich Peru Margin, and higher expression of motility genes in the Peru Margin samples. Higher expression of genes associated with metals transporters and antibiotic resistance and production was detected in Canterbury Basin sediments. A poly-A focused metatranscriptome produced for the Canterbury Basin sample from 345 mbsf provides further evidence for active fungal communities in the subsurface in the form of fungal-associated transcripts for metabolic and cellular processes, cell and membrane functions, and catalytic activities. Fungal communities at comparable depths at the two geographically separated locations appear dominated by distinct taxa. Differences in taxonomic composition and expression of genes associated with particular metabolic activities may be a function of sediment organic content as well as oceanic province. Microscopic analysis of Canterbury Basin sediment samples from 4 and 403 mbsf produced visualizations of septate fungal filaments, branching fungi, conidiogenesis, and spores. These images provide another important line of evidence supporting the occurrence and activity of fungi in the deep subseafloor biosphere.

"Candidatus Achromatium palustre" was recently described as the first marine representative of the Achromatium spp. in the Thiotrichaceae - a sister lineage to the Chromatiaceae in the Gammaproteobacteria. Achromatium spp. belong to the group of large sulfur bacteria as they can grow to nearly 100 mym in size and store elemental sulfur (S(0)) intracellularly. As a unique feature, Achromatium spp. can accumulate colloidal calcite (CaCO3) inclusions in great amounts. Currently, both process and function of calcite accumulation in bacteria is unknown, and all Achromatium spp. are uncultured.

MGYS00004328	Taxonomic composition of microbial communities in coastal Arctic sediments	The taxonomic composition of microbial communities was examined in two sediment cores taken off the coast of Alaska in the Beaufort Sea in 2009.

To examine community composition, variable regions V6-V8 of 16S rRNA genes were amplified using primers 926F and 1392R and the products were sequenced by pyrosequencing.  The analyses indicated that bacteria made up >95% of all sequences while eukaryotes contributed about 3% of the total. Less than 1% of all sequences could be assigned to archaea.  Archaea were relatively more abundant in the methane-rich core than in the methane-poor core.

Large spatial scales and long-term shifts of bacterial community composition (BCC) in the open ocean can often be reliably predicted based on the dynamics of physical-chemical variables. The power of abiotic factors in shaping BCC on shorter time scales in shallow estuarine mixing zones is less clear. We examined the diurnal variation in BCC at different water depths in the spring and fall of 2011 at a station in the Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS). This site is located in the transition zone between the estuarine plume and continental shelf waters of the South Atlantic Bight. A total of 234,516 pyrotag sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were recovered; they were taxonomically affiliated with &gt;200 families of 23 bacterial phyla. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed significant differences in BCC between spring and fall samples, likely due to seasonality in the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate plus nitrite. Within each diurnal sampling, BCC differed significantly by depth only in the spring and differed significantly between day and night only in the fall. The former variation largely tracked changes in light availability, while the latter was most correlated with concentrations of polyamines and chlorophyll a. Our results suggest that at the GRNMS, a coastal mixing zone, diurnal variation in BCC is attributable to the mixing of local and imported bacterioplankton rather than to bacterial growth in response to environmental changes. Our results also indicate that, like members of the Roseobacter clade, SAR11 bacteria may play an important role in processing dissolved organic material in coastal oceans.

Archaea have multiple roles in global biogeochemical cycles. However, we still have limited knowledge about how environmental factors affect the diversity and function of different archaeal lineages. The goal of this study was to examine the change in the abundance and community structure of Archaea in the sediments collected from the lower Pearl River (mainly North River tributary), its estuary, and coastal South China Sea (SCS) in order to evaluate how archaeal ecological function might change along the salinity gradient. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA gene of Archaea was performed on sediment samples from Feilaixia Dam on the North River tributary to Wanshan islands, which have a salinity range of 0.1 to 31.2permille. Consistent with the salt tolerance of cultivated representatives, methanogens in the genera Methanoregula, Methanosaeta, and Methanosarcina and Nitrososphaera within Thaumarchaeota of the ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) were abundant in freshwater sediments of the North River tributary, whereas the marine-associated genera Methanococcoides and Nitrosopumilus were the most abundant methanogens and AOA, respectively, in the estuary and coastal SCS. However, the percentages of total methanogens decreased and Thaumarchaeota increased with salinity, respectively. The phylum Crenarchaeota was largely represented by class-level lineages with no cultivated representatives, which collectively were more abundant in the estuary and coastal SCS in comparison to freshwater sites. This study indicates that salinity is the dominating factor affecting archaeal community structure and ecological function from the North River tributary of the Pearl River, its estuary, and coastal SCS, which is consistent with salinity control on microbial diversity in other regions of the world.

In the Zambales ophiolite range, terrestrial serpentinizing fluid seeps host diverse microbial assemblages. The fluids fall within the profile of Ca(2+)-OH(-)-type waters, indicative of active serpentinization, and are low in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (&lt;0.5 ppm). Influx of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) affects the solubility of calcium carbonate as distance from the source increases, triggering the formation of meter-scale travertine terraces. Samples were collected at the source and along the outflow channel to determine subsurface microbial community response to surface exposure. DNA was extracted and submitted for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Taxonomic assignment of the sequence data indicates that 8.1% of the total sequence reads at the source of the seep affiliate with the genus Methanobacterium. Other major classes detected at the source include anaerobic taxa such as Bacteroidetes (40.7% of total sequence reads) and Firmicutes (19.1% of total reads). Hydrogenophaga spp. increase in relative abundance as redox potential increases. At the carbonate terrace, 45% of sequence reads affiliate with Meiothermus spp. Taxonomic observations and geochemical data suggest that several putative metabolisms may be favorable, including hydrogen oxidation, H2-associated sulfur cycling, methanogenesis, methanotrophy, nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, denitrification, nitrate respiration, methylotrophy, carbon monoxide respiration, and ferrous iron oxidation, based on capabilities of nearest known neighbors. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy suggest that microbial activity produces chemical and physical traces in the precipitated carbonates forming downstream of the seep's source. These data provide context for future serpentinizing seep ecosystem studies, particularly with regards to tropical biomes.																																													
MGYS00004164	Seawater coastal British Columbia	Examine the distribution of specific markers genes over time	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	30687251	First Viruses Infecting the Marine Diatom Guinardia delicatula.	The marine diatom <i>Guinardia delicatula</i> is a cosmopolitan species that dominates seasonal blooms in the English Channel and the North Sea. Several eukaryotic parasites are known to induce the mortality of this species. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the first viruses that infect <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>. Viruses were isolated from the Western English Channel (SOMLIT-Astan station) during the late summer bloom decline of <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>. A combination of laboratory approaches revealed that these lytic viruses (GdelRNAV) are small tailless particles of 35-38 nm in diameter that replicate in the host cytoplasm where both unordered particles and crystalline arrays are formed. GdelRNAV display a linear single-stranded RNA genome of ~9 kb, including two open reading frames encoding for replication and structural polyproteins. Phylogenetic relationships based on the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase gene marker showed that GdelRNAV are new members of the <i>Bacillarnavirus</i>, a monophyletic genus belonging to the order <i>Picornavirales</i>. GdelRNAV are specific to several strains of <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>. They were rapidly and largely produced (&lt;12 h, 9.34 x 10<sup>4</sup> virions per host cell). Our analysis points out the host's variable viral susceptibilities during the early exponential growth phase. Interestingly, we consistently failed to isolate viruses during spring and early summer while <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i> developed important blooms. While our study suggests that viruses do contribute to the decline of <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>'s late summer bloom, they may not be the primary mortality agents during the remaining blooms at SOMLIT-Astan. Future studies should focus on the relative contribution of the viral and eukaryotic pathogens to the control of <i>Guinardia</i>'s blooms to understand the fate of these prominent organisms in marine systems.	25566218	High temporal and spatial diversity in marine RNA viruses implies that they have an important role in mortality and structuring plankton communities.	Viruses in the order Picornavirales infect eukaryotes, and are widely distributed in coastal waters. Amplicon deep-sequencing of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed diverse and highly uneven communities of picorna-like viruses in the coastal waters of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Almost 300 000 pyrosequence reads revealed 145 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 95% sequence similarity at the amino-acid level. Each sample had between 24 and 71 OTUs and there was little overlap among samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that some clades of OTUs were only found at one site; whereas, other clades included OTUs from all sites. Since most of these OTUs are likely from viruses that infect eukaryotic phytoplankton, and viral isolates infecting phytoplankton are strain-specific; each OTU probably arose from the lysis of a specific phytoplankton taxon. Moreover, the patchiness in OTU distribution, and the high turnover of viruses in the mixed layer, implies continuous infection and lysis by RNA viruses of a diverse array of eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa. Hence, these viruses are likely important elements structuring the phytoplankton community, and play a significant role in nutrient cycling and energy transfer.

Glaciers and their microbiomes are exceptional witnesses of the environmental conditions from remote times. Climate change is threatening mountain glaciers, and especially those found in southern Europe, such as the Monte Perdido Glacier (northern Spain, Central Pyrenees). This study focuses on the reconstruction of the history of microbial communities over time. The microorganisms that inhabit the Monte Perdido Glacier were identified using high-throughput sequencing, and the microbial communities were compared along an altitudinal transect covering most of the preserved ice sequence in the glacier. The results showed that the glacial ice age gradient did shape the diversity of microbial populations, which presented large differences throughout the last 2000 years. Variations in microbial community diversity were influenced by glacial conditions over time (nutrient concentration, chemical composition, and ice age). Some groups were exclusively identified in the oldest samples as the bacterial phyla Fusobacteria and Calditrichaeota, or the eukaryotic class Rhodophyceae. Among groups only found in modern samples, the green sulfur bacteria (phylum Chlorobi) stood out, as well as the bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadetes and the eukaryotic class Tubulinea. A patent impact of human contamination was also observed on the glacier microbiome. The oldest samples, corresponding to the Roman Empire times, were influenced by the beginning of mining exploitation in the Pyrenean area, with the presence of metal-tolerant microorganisms. The most recent samples comprise 600-year-old ancient ice in which current communities are living.	31434915	Taxonomic and functional characterization of a microbial community from a volcanic englacial ecosystem in Deception Island, Antarctica.	Glaciers are populated by a large number of microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and microeukaryotes. Several factors such as solar radiation, nutrient availability and water content greatly determine the diversity and abundance of these microbial populations, the type of metabolism and the biogeochemical cycles. Three ecosystems can be differentiated in glaciers: supraglacial, subglacial and englacial ecosystems. Firstly, the supraglacial ecosystem, sunlit and oxygenated, is predominantly populated by photoautotrophic microorganisms. Secondly, the subglacial ecosystem contains a majority of chemoautotrophs that are fed on the mineral salts of the rocks and basal soil. Lastly, the englacial ecosystem is the least studied and the one that contains the smallest number of microorganisms. However, these unknown englacial microorganisms establish a food web and appear to have an active metabolism. In order to study their metabolic potentials, samples of englacial ice were taken from an Antarctic glacier. Microorganisms were analyzed by a polyphasic approach that combines a set of -omic techniques: 16S rRNA sequencing, culturomics and metaproteomics. This combination provides key information about diversity and functions of microbial populations, especially in rare habitats. Several whole essential proteins and enzymes related to metabolism and energy production, recombination and translation were found that demonstrate the existence of cellular activity at subzero temperatures. In this way it is shown that the englacial microorganisms are not quiescent, but that they maintain an active metabolism and play an important role in the glacial microbial community.																																										
MGYS00004174	dsrB gene diversity in marine coastal sediments in Aarhus Bay, Denmark	Sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) are key players in the marine carbon and sulfur cycles, especially in coastal sediments. We identified and characterised SRM using dsrB gene sequencing in a marine coastal sediment in Aarhus Bay, Denmark.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment	28939599	Depth Distribution and Assembly of Sulfate-Reducing Microbial Communities in Marine Sediments of Aarhus Bay.	Most sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRMs) present in subsurface marine sediments belong to uncultured groups only distantly related to known SRMs, and it remains unclear how changing geochemical zones and sediment depth influence their community structure. We mapped the community composition and abundance of SRMs by amplicon sequencing and quantifying the <i>dsrB</i> gene, which encodes dissimilatory sulfite reductase subunit beta, in sediment samples covering different vertical geochemical zones ranging from the surface sediment to the deep sulfate-depleted subsurface at four locations in Aarhus Bay, Denmark. SRMs were present in all geochemical zones, including sulfate-depleted methanogenic sediment. The biggest shift in SRM community composition and abundance occurred across the transition from bioturbated surface sediments to nonbioturbated sediments below, where redox fluctuations and the input of fresh organic matter due to macrofaunal activity are absent. SRM abundance correlated with sulfate reduction rates determined for the same sediments. Sulfate availability showed a weaker correlation with SRM abundances and no significant correlation with the composition of the SRM community. The overall SRM species diversity decreased with depth, yet we identified a subset of highly abundant community members that persists across all vertical geochemical zones of all stations. We conclude that subsurface SRM communities assemble by the persistence of members of the surface community and that the transition from the bioturbated surface sediment to the unmixed sediment below is a main site of assembly of the subsurface SRM community.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRMs) are key players in the marine carbon and sulfur cycles, especially in coastal sediments, yet little is understood about the environmental factors controlling their depth distribution. Our results suggest that macrofaunal activity is a key driver of SRM abundance and community structure in marine sediments and that a small subset of SRM species of high relative abundance in the subsurface SRM community persists from the sulfate-rich surface sediment to sulfate-depleted methanogenic subsurface sediment. More generally, we conclude that SRM communities inhabiting the subsurface seabed assemble by the selective survival of members of the surface community.

An ecosystem is a community comprising living and nonliving components of the environment. Microbes are ubiquitous elements in each of these components. The dynamics of microbiota formation in an ecosystem is important to elucidate, because how the different components of a system exchange microbes, and how the microbes control ecological processes remain unresolved. In this study, an abalone, Haliotis diversicolor, seed-nursing pond was used as a model system. We first examined changes in bacterial communities during the seedling cultivation of this herbivorous juvenile aquatic invertebrate animal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing were used to analyze bacterial community dynamics and spatio-temporal interactions of different system components: consumers (abalone), producers (algae or a substrate), and the environment (water). DGGE fingerprints revealed that the developmental stages of abalone influences bacterial communities of both the abalone and substrate. Although the communities in water fluctuated daily, they could be divided into two clusters that coincided with abalone stages, reflecting the transition from larva to juvenile at around day 21. Pyrosequencing showed that the microbiota in the abalone and substrate had more operational taxonomic units in common than that of either with water. The Bray-Curtis similarity index was used to quantify the formation dynamics of microbiota among the various components of the system. The bacterial communities in producers and consumers showed similar changes. These communities were unstable at the beginning and then slowly stabilized over time. The environmental bacterial community was more stable than the bacterial communities in consumers and producers, and may have been the basis for stability in the system. Our research provides insights into the dynamics of microbiota formation in various biotic elements of a system that will contribute to predictive systems modeling.

Protists are pivotal components of marine ecosystems in terms of their high diversity, but protist communities have been poorly explored in benthic environments. Here, we investigated protist diversity and community assembly in surface sediments in the South China Sea (SCS) at a basin scale. Pyrosequencing of 18S rDNA was performed for a total of six samples taken from the surface seafloor at water depths ranging from 79 to 2,939 m. We found that Cercozoa was the dominant group, accounting for an average of 39.9% and 25.3% of the reads and operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. The Cercozoa taxa were highly diverse, comprising 14 phylogenetic clades, six of which were affiliated with unknown groups belonging to Filosa and Endomyxa. Fungi were also an important group in both read- (18.1% on average) and OTU-derived (9.3% on average) results. Moreover, the turnover patterns of the protist communities were differently explained by species sorting (53.3%), dispersal limitation (33.3%), mass effects (0%), and drift (13.3%). In summary, our findings show that the basin-wide protist communities in the surface sediments of the SCS are primarily dominated by Cercozoa and are mainly assembled by species sorting and dispersal limitation.

Subseafloor sediments accumulate large amounts of organic and inorganic materials that contain a highly diverse microbial ecosystem. The aim of this study was to survey the bacterial community of subseafloor sediments from the South China Sea. Pyrosequencing of over 265,000 amplicons of the V3 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was performed on 16 sediment samples collected from multiple locations in the northern region of the South China Sea from depths ranging from 35 to 4000 m. A total of 9,726 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; between 695 and 2819 unique OTUs per sample) at 97% sequence similarity level were generated. In total, 40 bacterial phyla including 22 formally described phyla and 18 candidate phyla, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi being most diverse, were identified. The most abundant phylotype, accounting for 42.6% of all sequences, belonged to Gammaproteobacteria, which possessed absolute predominance in the samples analyzed. Among the 18 candidate phyla, 12 were found for the first time in the South China Sea. This study provided a novel insight into the composition of bacterial communities of the South China Sea subseafloor. Furthermore, abundances and community similarity analysis showed that the compositions of the bacterial communities are very similar at phylum level at different depths from 35-4000 m.

Haptophytes are a key phylum of marine protists, including ~300 described morphospecies and 80 morphogenera. We used 454 pyrosequencing on large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) fragments to assess the diversity from size-fractioned plankton samples collected in the Bay of Naples. One group-specific primer set targeting the LSU rDNA D1/D2 region was designed to amplify Haptophyte sequences from nucleic acid extracts (total DNA or RNA) of two size fractions (0.8-3 or 3-20 mym) and two sampling depths [subsurface, at 1 m, or deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) at 23 m]. 454 reads were identified using a database covering the entire Haptophyta diversity currently sequenced. Our data set revealed several hundreds of Haptophyte clusters. However, most of these clusters could not be linked to taxonomically known sequences: considering OTUs(97%) (clusters build at a sequence identity level of 97%) on our global data set, less than 1% of the reads clustered with sequences from cultures, and less than 12% clustered with reference sequences obtained previously from cloning and Sanger sequencing of environmental samples. Thus, we highlighted a large uncharacterized environmental genetic diversity, which clearly shows that currently cultivated species poorly reflect the actual diversity present in the natural environment. Haptophyte community appeared to be significantly structured according to the depth. The highest diversity and evenness were obtained in samples from the DCM, and samples from the large size fraction (3-20 mym) taken at the DCM shared a lower proportion of common OTUs(97%) with the other samples. Reads from the species Chrysoculter romboideus were notably found at the DCM, while they could be detected at the subsurface. The highest proportion of totally unknown OTUs(97%) was collected at the DCM in the smallest size fraction (0.8-3 mym). Overall, this study emphasized several technical and theoretical barriers inherent to the exploration of the large and largely unknown diversity of unicellular eukaryotes.																																													
MGYS00003989	Marine bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic diversity and community structure on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula	The classic view of polar ocean foodwebs emphasizes large predators sustained by energy and materials flow through short, efficient diatom-krill-predator food chains. Bacterial activity is generally low in cold polar waters compared to lower latitudes. This view appears to be changing, with new studies of microbial foodwebs in Arctic and Antarctic oceans. We characterized bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community diversity and composition from two depths (near surface and below the euphotic zone) at four sites, including the inshore and offshore, and north and south corners of a sampling grid along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We detected up to 2-fold higher richness in microbial eukaryotes at surface and deep inshore northern stations as compared to southern ones but offshore northern and southern stations revealed either no trend or higher richness at depth in the south. In contrast, bacterial and archaeal richness showed no significant differences either inshore or offshore at northern versus southern extents but did vary with depth. Archaea were virtually absent in summer surface waters but were present in summer deep and winter surface samples. Overall, winter bacterial and archaeal assemblages most closely resembled summer sub-euphotic zone assemblages, reflecting well-established seasonal patterns of water column turnover and stratification that result in an isolated layer of winter water below the euphotic zone. Inter-domain heterotroph-phototroph interactions were evident from network analysis. The WAP is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth. Our results provide a baseline against which future change in microbial communities may be assessed.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

Ammonia oxidation plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) are the key contributors to ammonia oxidation, and their relative contribution to this process is one of the most important issues related to the nitrogen cycle in the ocean. In this study, the differential contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation in surface sediments from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay were studied based on the ammonia monooxygenase (<i>amoA</i>) gene. Molecular biology techniques were used to analyze ammonia oxidizers' community characteristics, and potential nitrification incubation was applied to understand the ammonia oxidizers' community activity. The objective was to determine the community structure and activity of AOA and AOB in surface sediments from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay and to discuss the different contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation during summer and winter seasons in the studied area. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the diversity of AOA was higher than that of AOB. The majority of AOA and AOB clustered into <i>Nitrosopumilus</i> and <i>Nitrosospira</i>, respectively, indicating that the <i>Nitrosopumilus</i> group and <i>Nitrosospira</i> groups may be more adaptable in studied sediments. The AOA community was closely correlated to temperature, salinity and ammonium concentration, whereas the AOB community showed a stronger correlation with temperature, chlorophyll-<i>a</i> content (chla) and nitrite concentration. qPCR results showed that both the abundance and the transcript abundance of AOA was consistently greater than that of AOB. AOA and AOB differentially contributed to ammonia oxidation in different seasons. AOB occupied the dominant position in mediating ammonia oxidation during summer, while AOA might play a dominant role in ammonia oxidation during winter.

Integrating these measurements with microbial community composition data is highly desirable because it would allow hypotheses about biogeographic distributions to be tested or perhaps lead to the discovery of organisms responsible for a particular biogeochemical process. A promising strategy to generate this microbial community composition data comes from high-throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons generated with the 515Y/926R universal 16S/18S primer set. The two key advantages of the 515Y/926R primers are 1) their comprehensiveness - recovering amplicons from the entire cellular microbial community - and 2) their quantitative nature - recovering gene copy abundances as shown previously with microbial community standards. Compared to metagenomes, amplicons additionally have the advantage of more easily detecting rare community members that may be biogeochemically significant (e.g. diazotrophs). In this study, we applied the 515Y/926R primers to DNA from the recently published bioGEOTRACES metagenomic dataset, and use these results to describe microbial community composition across a longitudinal transect of the southern Pacific Ocean from Australia to Tahiti (GEOTRACES section GP13) and a longitudinal transect of the northern Atlantic from Massachusetts to the Canary Islands (GEOTRACES section GA03). In addition, we conducted intercomparisons with metagenomic taxa abundances and show the two techniques correspond strongly to one another for most samples (average R^2=0.97).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic	34060911	Evaluating and Improving Small Subunit rRNA PCR Primer Coverage for Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes Using Metagenomes from Global Ocean Surveys.	Small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) amplicon sequencing can quantitatively and comprehensively profile natural microbiomes, representing a critically important tool for studying diverse global ecosystems. However, results will only be accurate if PCR primers perfectly match the rRNA of all organisms present. To evaluate how well marine microorganisms across all 3 domains are detected by this method, we compared commonly used primers with &gt;300 million rRNA gene sequences retrieved from globally distributed marine metagenomes. The best-performing primers compared to 16S rRNA of bacteria and archaea were 515Y/926R and 515Y/806RB, which perfectly matched over 96% of all sequences. Considering cyanobacterial and chloroplast 16S rRNA, 515Y/926R had the highest coverage (99%), making this set ideal for quantifying marine primary producers. For eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences, 515Y/926R also performed best (88%), followed by V4R/V4RB (18S rRNA specific; 82%)-demonstrating that the 515Y/926R combination performs best overall for all 3 domains. Using Atlantic and Pacific Ocean samples, we demonstrate high correspondence between 515Y/926R amplicon abundances (generated for this study) and metagenomic 16S rRNA (median <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.98, <i>n</i> = 272), indicating amplicons can produce equally accurate community composition data compared with shotgun metagenomics. Our analysis also revealed that expected performance of all primer sets could be improved with minor modifications, pointing toward a nearly completely universal primer set that could accurately quantify biogeochemically important taxa in ecosystems ranging from the deep sea to the surface. In addition, our reproducible bioinformatic workflow can guide microbiome researchers studying different ecosystems or human health to similarly improve existing primers and generate more accurate quantitative amplicon data. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> PCR amplification and sequencing of marker genes is a low-cost technique for monitoring prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities across space and time but will work optimally only if environmental organisms match PCR primer sequences exactly. In this study, we evaluated how well primers match globally distributed short-read oceanic metagenomes. Our results demonstrate that primer sets vary widely in performance, and that at least for marine systems, rRNA amplicon data from some primers lack significant biases compared to metagenomes. We also show that it is theoretically possible to create a nearly universal primer set for diverse saline environments by defining a specific mixture of a few dozen oligonucleotides, and present a software pipeline that can guide rational design of primers for any environment with available meta'omic data.																																													
MGYS00004506	Surface Diatom Sediments of Deep Freshwater Lake Baikal	In this work we analyzed the structure and diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities in the surface sediment core. Microscopy has shown that this core is rich in siliceous diatom valves (frustules), whose degrees of preservation varied with the depth and diatom species as revealed by SEM.

We specifically focused on community changes induced by increased availability of Fe3+ and Mn4+, which were studied by laboratory incubation of sediment samples collected from the profundal site.

MGYS00004081	Microbial Community Diversity Response to a Changing Arctic Ocean	Increasing global temperatures are having a profound impact in the Arctic, including the dramatic loss of multiyear sea ice in 2007 that has continued to the present. The majority of life in the Arctic is microbial and the consequences of climate-mediated changes on microbial marine food webs, which are responsible for biogeochemical cycling and support higher trophic levels, are unknown. We examined microbial communities over time by using high-throughput sequencing of microbial DNA collected between 2003 and 2010 from the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer of the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic). We found that overall this layer has freshened and concentrations of nitrate, the limiting nutrient for photosynthetic production in Arctic seas, have decreased. We compared microbial communities from before and after the record September 2007 sea ice minimum and detected significant differences in communities from all three domains of life. In particular, there were significant changes in species composition of Eukarya, with ciliates becoming more common and heterotrophic marine stramenopiles (MASTs) accounting for a smaller proportion of sequences retrieved after 2007. Within the Archaea, Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota, which earlier represented up to 60% of the Archaea sequences in this layer, have declined to <10%. Bacterial communities overall were less diverse after 2007, with a significant decrease of the Bacteroidetes. These significant shifts suggest that the microbial food webs are sensitive to physical oceanographic changes such as those occurring in the Canadian Arctic over the past decade.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic																																																
MGYS00004678	Sequences obtained from two sponge genera (Hyrtios, Aiolochroia), one zoanthid (Palythoa), and marine sediments. Metagenome	Study of the diversity of bacteria present in sponges and marine sediment, by 16s rRNA gene sequencing	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Coral reef	25723107	Acidobacteria appear to dominate the microbiome of two sympatric Caribbean Sponges and one Zoanthid.	Marine invertebrate-associated microbial communities are interesting examples of complex symbiotic systems and are a potential source of biotechnological products. In this work, pyrosequencing-based assessment from bacterial community structures of sediments, two sponges, and one zoanthid collected in the Mexican Caribbean was performed. The results suggest that the bacterial diversity at the species level is higher in the sediments than in the animal samples. Analysis of bacterial communities' structure showed that about two thirds of the bacterial diversity in all the samples belongs to the phyla Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria. The genus Acidobacterium appears to dominate the bacterial community in all the samples, reaching almost 80% in the sponge Hyrtios. Our evidence suggests that the sympatric location of these benthonic species may lead to common bacterial structure features among their bacterial communities. The results may serve as a first insight to formulate hypotheses that lead to more extensive studies of sessile marine organisms' microbiomes from the Mexican Caribbean.																																													
MGYS00004696	Fungal communities across four coastal marine habitats in North Carolina, USA	Despite nearly a century of study, the diversity of marine fungi remains poorly understood. Historical surveys utilizing microscopy or culture-dependent methods suggest that marine fungi are relatively species-poor, predominantly Dikarya, and localized to coastal habitats. However, the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize microbial communities has challenged traditional concepts of fungal diversity by revealing novel phylotypes from both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Here, I used ion semiconductor sequencing (Ion Torrent) of the ribosomal large subunit (LSU/28S) to explore fungal diversity from water and sediment samples collected from four habitats in coastal North Carolina. The dominant taxa observed were Ascomycota and Chytridiomycota, though all fungal phyla were represented. Diversity was highest in sand flats and wetland sediments, though benthic sediments harbored the highest proportion of novel sequences. Most sequences assigned to early-diverging fungal groups could not be assigned beyond phylum with statistical support, suggesting they belong to unknown lineages.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal																																																
MGYS00004055	Structuring effect of environmental variables on protistan diversity patterns in two anoxic marine basins	The tenet that 'everything is everywhere, but the environment selects' has influenced microbiology for several decades, and is still debated controversially. However, the proof or disproof of the hypothesis still remains difficult. Scant data from prokaryotic studies suggest that at least over large distances historical separation may overwhelm environmental effects, challenging the above mentioned hypothesis. Though, at smaller spatial scales, environmental effects seem to dominate diversity patterns, while distance effects are of secondary importance. We tried to contribute to the ongoing discussion by investigating patterns of protistan diversity from two geographically separated marine anoxic basins (Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, Framvaren Fjord, Norway). To take distance and environmental effects into account, each basin was sampled at two different locations along an environmental gradient. Biodiversity patterns were analyzed by applying the 454 sequencing technique. Resulting data sets were used to examine overall diversity of samples under study and to compare recorded community patterns based on taxonomic composition and similarity indices. By combining our results with contextual data from both sampling sites we tested for distance effects in relation to contemporary environmental effects.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	19886985	Massively parallel tag sequencing reveals the complexity of anaerobic marine protistan communities.	Recent advances in sequencing strategies make possible unprecedented depth and scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Two major paradigm-shifting discoveries include the detection of bacterial diversity that is one to two orders of magnitude greater than previous estimates, and the discovery of an exciting 'rare biosphere' of molecular signatures ('species') of poorly understood ecological significance. We applied a high-throughput parallel tag sequencing (454 sequencing) protocol adopted for eukaryotes to investigate protistan community complexity in two contrasting anoxic marine ecosystems (Framvaren Fjord, Norway; Cariaco deep-sea basin, Venezuela). Both sampling sites have previously been scrutinized for protistan diversity by traditional clone library construction and Sanger sequencing. By comparing these clone library data with 454 amplicon library data, we assess the efficiency of high-throughput tag sequencing strategies. We here present a novel, highly conservative bioinformatic analysis pipeline for the processing of large tag sequence data sets. The analyses of ca. 250,000 sequence reads revealed that the number of detected Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) far exceeded previous richness estimates from the same sites based on clone libraries and Sanger sequencing. More than 90% of this diversity was represented by OTUs with less than 10 sequence tags. We detected a substantial number of taxonomic groups like Apusozoa, Chrysomerophytes, Centroheliozoa, Eustigmatophytes, hyphochytriomycetes, Ichthyosporea, Oikomonads, Phaeothamniophytes, and rhodophytes which remained undetected by previous clone library-based diversity surveys of the sampling sites. The most important innovations in our newly developed bioinformatics pipeline employ (i) BLASTN with query parameters adjusted for highly variable domains and a complete database of public ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences for taxonomic assignments of tags; (ii) a clustering of tags at k differences (Levenshtein distance) with a newly developed algorithm enabling very fast OTU clustering for large tag sequence data sets; and (iii) a novel parsing procedure to combine the data from individual analyses. Our data highlight the magnitude of the under-sampled 'protistan gap' in the eukaryotic tree of life. This study illustrates that our current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, and of the global species richness and genome diversity of protists, is severely limited. Even though 454 pyrosequencing is not a panacea, it allows for more comprehensive insights into the diversity of protistan communities, and combined with appropriate statistical tools, enables improved ecological interpretations of the data and projections of global diversity.

MGYS00005629	a take on the impact of pollution on coastal bacterial communities	Coral reefs face increased environmental threats from anthropomorphic climate change and pollution, from agriculture, industries and tourism. They are economically vital for many people worldwide, and harbour a fantastically diverse ecosystem, being the home for many species of fish and algae. Surprisingly little is known about the microbial communities living in and in the surrounding of coral reefs. The objectives of this project is to characterise the community composition and function of bacteria living in the water and the upper sediment layer in close proximity of coral reefs. In this project we sequenced 3 water samples and 3 sediment samples out of the coast of Kenya, at 3 distinct location: Mombasa, Malindi and Kisite.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Coral reef	34248882	Cross-Sectional Variations in Structure and Function of Coral Reef Microbiome With Local Anthropogenic Impacts on the Kenyan Coast of the Indian Ocean.	Coral reefs face an increased number of environmental threats from anthropomorphic climate change and pollution from agriculture, industries and sewage. Because environmental changes lead to their compositional and functional shifts, coral reef microbial communities can serve as indicators of ecosystem impacts through development of rapid and inexpensive molecular monitoring tools. Little is known about coral reef microbial communities of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). We compared taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities inhabiting near-coral seawater and sediments from Kenyan reefs exposed to varying impacts of human activities. Over 19,000 species (bacterial, viral and archaeal combined) and 4,500 clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) were annotated. The coral reefs showed variations in the relative abundances of ecologically significant taxa, especially copiotrophic bacteria and coliphages, corresponding to the magnitude of the neighboring human impacts in the respective sites. Furthermore, the near-coral seawater and sediment metagenomes had an overrepresentation of COGs for functions related to adaptation to diverse environments. Malindi and Mombasa marine parks, the coral reef sites closest to densely populated settlements were significantly enriched with genes for functions suggestive of mitigation of environment perturbations including the capacity to reduce intracellular levels of environmental contaminants and repair of DNA damage. Our study is the first metagenomic assessment of WIO coral reef microbial diversity which provides a much-needed baseline for the region, and points to a potential area for future research toward establishing indicators of environmental perturbations.

Regulatory tests assess crop protection product environmental fate and toxicity before approval for commercial use. Although globally applied laboratory tests can assess biodegradation, they lack environmental complexity. Microbial communities are subject to temporal and spatial variation, but there is little consideration of these microbial dynamics in the laboratory. Here, we investigated seasonal variation in the microbial composition of water and sediment from a UK river across a two-year time course and determined its effect on the outcome of water-sediment (OECD 308) and water-only (OECD 309) biodegradation tests, using the fungicide isopyrazam. These OECD tests are performed under dark conditions, so test systems incubated under non-UV light:dark cycles were also included to determine the impact on both inoculum characteristics and biodegradation. Isopyrazam degradation was faster when incubated under non-UV light at all collection times in water-sediment microcosms, suggesting that phototrophic communities can metabolise isopyrazam throughout the year. Degradation rate varied seasonally between inoculum collection times only in microcosms incubated in the light, but isopyrazam mineralisation to <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> varied seasonally under both light and dark conditions, suggesting that heterotrophic communities may also play a role in degradation. Bacterial and phototroph communities varied across time, but there was no clear link between water or sediment microbial composition and variation in degradation rate. During the test period, inoculum microbial community composition changed, particularly in non-UV light incubated microcosms. Overall, we show that regulatory test outcome is not influenced by temporal variation in microbial community structure; however, biodegradation rates from higher tier studies with improved environmental realism, e.g. through addition of non-UV light, may be more variable. These data suggest that standardised OECD tests can provide a conservative estimate of pesticide persistence end points and that additional tests including non-UV light could help bridge the gap between standard tests and field studies.

Seagrass colonization changes the chemistry and biogeochemical cycles mediated by microbes in coastal sediments. In this study, we molecularly characterized the diazotrophic assemblages and entire bacterial community in surface sediments of a Zostera marina-colonized coastal lagoon in northern China. Higher nitrogenase gene (nifH) copy numbers were detected in the sediments from the vegetated region than in the sediments from the unvegetated region nearby. The nifH phylotypes detected were mostly affiliated with the Geobacteraceae, Desulfobulbus, Desulfocapsa, and Pseudomonas. Redundancy analysis based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that the distribution of nifH genotypes was mostly shaped by the ratio of total organic carbon to total organic nitrogen, the concentration of cadmium in the sediments, and the pH of the overlying water. High-throughput sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA genes also indicated the presence of Geobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae phylotypes in these samples. A comparison of these results with those of previous studies suggests the prevalence and predominance of iron(III)-reducing Geobacteraceae and sulfate-reducing Desulfobulbaceae diazotrophs in coastal sedimentary environments. Although the entire bacterial community structure was not significantly different between these two niches, Desulfococcus (Deltaproteobacteria) and Anaerolineae (Chloroflexi) presented with much higher proportions in the vegetated sediments, and Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteroidetes) occurred more frequently in the bare sediments. These data suggest that the high bioavailability of organic matter (indicated by relatively lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratios) and the less-reducing anaerobic condition in vegetated sediments may favor Desulfococcus and Anaerolineae lineages, which are potentially important populations in benthic carbon and sulfur cycling in the highly productive seagrass ecosystem.

The program covers a suite of physical (light, heat, currents, water column structure, etc.) and chemical (nutrients, oxygen, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, pH, etc.) state variables over the full ocean water column, and in areas of the ocean inaccessible to other platforms. The principal scientific objectives for GO-SHIP are: (1) understanding and documenting the large-scale ocean water property distributions, their changes, and drivers of those changes, and (2) addressing questions of how a future ocean will increase in dissolved inorganic carbon, become more acidified and more stratified, and experience changes in circulation and ventilation processes due to global warming and altered water cycle.The vision of the biological GO-SHIP initiative, or "Bio-GO-SHIP," is to develop a deep understanding of the link between the physio-chemical environment and global ocean plankton diversity, abundance, and biogeochemical roles in the context of a changing ocean. This will be achieved through systematic, high-quality, and calibrated sampling of marine 'omics products.In this BioProject, we aim to provide a singular resource for Bio-GO-SHIP 'omics datasets.

Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes along with flow-cytometry counts of bacteria, cyanobacteria and photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) we described picoplanktonic community in the oligotrophic ecosystem. With pigment and lipid analyses of picoplankton community, we characterized PPEs and detected specific events in microbial loop. Prokaryotic community was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, mainly SAR11 clade (44.91%), followed by Gammaproteobacteria (Oceanospirillales and Pseudomonadales, 14.96%), Bacteroidetes, mainly Flavobacteriales (13%), Cyanobacteria (Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, 9.52%), Marinimicrobia, SAR406 clade (7.97%), Deltaproteobacteria (3.83%), Actinobacteria (2.24%) and Chloroflexi (1.90%). Picoeukaryotes, although the drivers of photosynthetic activity in oligotrophic systems, in this study were dominated by heterotrophic counterparts: Syndiniales, parasitic dinoflagellates (79.67%), other Dinophyta (8.7%) and on two depths Collodaria, family Sphaerozoidae (22.1%) and Polycistinea, Spumellarida (5.0%), while total photoautotrophic fraction of picoeukaryotes were represented with Mamiellophyceae, Stramenopiles, photoautotrophic Cryptophyta and some Haptophyta, together not exceeding 5% of total sequences. Heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria, separated into populations of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, had abundances up to 7×105; 2.3×104 and 2.5×104 cells mL-1, respectively. Photoautotrophic picoeukaryotes were most abundant at P600-25m with 3×103 cells mL-1.

Large-scale high-throughput sequencing techniques are rapidly becoming popular methods to profile complex communities and have generated deep insights into community biodiversity. However, several technical problems, especially sequencing artifacts such as nucleotide calling errors, could artificially inflate biodiversity estimates. Sequence filtering for artifact removal is a conventional method for deleting error-prone sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. As rare species represented by low-abundance sequences in datasets may be sensitive to artifact removal process, the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery has not been well evaluated in natural complex communities. Here we employed both internal (reliable operational taxonomic units selected from communities themselves) and external (indicator species spiked into communities) references to evaluate the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery using 454 pyrosequencing of complex plankton communities collected from both freshwater and marine habitats. Multiple analyses revealed three clear patterns: 1) rare species were eliminated during sequence filtering process at all tested filtering stringencies, 2) more rare taxa were eliminated as filtering stringencies increased, and 3) elimination of rare species intensified as biomass of a species in a community was reduced. Our results suggest that cautions be applied when processing high-throughput sequencing data, especially for rare taxa detection for conservation of species at risk and for rapid response programs targeting non-indigenous species. Establishment of both internal and external references proposed here provides a practical strategy to evaluate artifact removal process.

Marine microbes have a pivotal role in the marine biogeochemical cycle of carbon, because they regulate the turnover of dissolved organic matter (DOM), one of the largest carbon reservoirs on Earth. Microbial communities and DOM are both highly diverse components of the ocean system, yet the role of microbial diversity for carbon processing remains thus far poorly understood. We report here results from an exploration of a mosaic of phytoplankton blooms induced by large-scale natural iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean. We show that in this unique ecosystem where concentrations of DOM are lowest in the global ocean, a patchwork of blooms is associated with diverse and distinct bacterial communities. By using on-board continuous cultures, we identify preferences in the degradation of DOM of different reactivity for taxa associated with contrasting blooms. We used the spatial and temporal variability provided by this natural laboratory to demonstrate that the magnitude of bacterial production is linked to the extent of compositional changes. Our results suggest that partitioning of the DOM resource could be a mechanism that structures bacterial communities with a positive feedback on carbon cycling. Our study, focused on bacterial carbon processing, highlights the potential role of diversity as a driving force for the cycling of biogeochemical elements.

MGYS00004310	sediment metagenome Metagenome	Benthic communities in the aquatic ecosystem are influenced by both natural and anthropogenic stressors. To understand the ecogenomic responses of sediment communities to the multiple stressors of polluted environments, the bacteria, protistanand metazoan communities in sediments from marine and adjacent riverine areas of North Bohai Sea were characterized by environmental DNA meta-systematics, and their associations with environmental variables were assessed bymultiple statistical approaches. The structures of communities in sediments were shaped by both natural variables and anthropogenic contaminants, including DDTs, PAHs or metals. Particularly, the correlation network of multiple communities was modulated by the concentrationsof Na and DDTs at the family level.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

Denitrification is an important microbial process in aquatic ecosystems that can reduce the effects of eutrophication. Here, quantification and pyrosequencing of nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes encoding for nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases was performed in sediment samples from four boreal lakes to determine the structure and seasonal stability of denitrifying microbial populations. Sediment quality and nitrate concentrations were linked to the quantity and diversity of denitrification genes, the abundance of denitrifying populations (nirS and nosZ genes) correlated with coupled nitrification-denitrification (Dn), and the denitrification of the overlying water NO3 (-) (Dw) correlated with the nirS/nirK ratio. The number of core nirS, nirK, and nosZ operational taxonomical units (OTUs) was low (6, 7, and 3, respectively), and most of these core OTUs were shared among the lakes. Dominant nirK sequences matched best with those of the order Rhizobiales, which was one of the main bacterial orders present in the sediment microbiomes, whereas the dominant nirS sequences were affiliated with the order Burkholderiales. Over half of the nosZ sequences belonged to a single OTU of the order Burkholderiales, but coupled nitrification-denitrification rate correlated with another dominant nosZ OTU assigned to the order Rhodospirillales. The study indicates that a few core proteobacterial clusters may drive denitrification in boreal lake sediments, as the same Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria denitrifier clusters were present in different lakes and seasons.

MGYS00004324	Temporal dynamics of bacterioplankton community in response to excessive nitrate loading in the oligotrophic coastal water	Coastal ecosystems are receiving elevated inputs of nitrogen (N), primarily as nitrate, from anthropogenic sources. Bacterioplankton play important roles in marine N-cycle. Understanding how excessive N-loading affects marine bacterioplankton communities is critical for the insight into the biodiversity of marine ecosystems under the condition of eutrophic disturbance. In this study, the oligotrophic coastal water microcosms were perturbed with a certain nitrate level of 1.0 mg L-1 in two loading modes: 1) one-off loading (OL) with the level of 1.0 mg L-1 at the beginning; 2) periodic loading (PL) with the level of 0.125 mg L-1 every two days during 16 days.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal

Surveying microbial diversity and function is accomplished by combining complementary molecular tools. Among them, metagenomics is a PCR free approach that contains all genetic information from microbial assemblages and is today performed at a relatively large scale and reasonable cost, mostly based on very short reads. Here, we investigated the potential of metagenomics to provide taxonomic reports of marine microbial eukaryotes. We prepared a curated database with reference sequences of the V4 region of 18S rDNA clustered at 97% similarity and used this database to extract and classify metagenomic reads. More than half of them were unambiguously affiliated to a unique reference whilst the rest could be assigned to a given taxonomic group. The overall diversity reported by metagenomics was similar to that obtained by amplicon sequencing of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene, although either one or both of these amplicon surveys performed poorly for groups like Excavata, Amoebozoa, Fungi and Haptophyta. We then studied the diversity of picoeukaryotes and nanoeukaryotes using 91 metagenomes from surface down to bathypelagic layers in different oceans, unveiling a clear taxonomic separation between size fractions and depth layers. Finally, we retrieved long rDNA sequences from assembled metagenomes that improved phylogenetic reconstructions of particular groups. Overall, this study shows metagenomics as an excellent resource for taxonomic exploration of marine microbial eukaryotes.

MGYS00004563	Deep sequencing of a DMSP-degrading gene (dmdA) in a coastal bacterioplankton community	Ten primer pairs targeting environmental clades of the dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) demethylase protein, DmdA, were designed using an iterative bioinformatic approach that took advantage of >1700 dmdA sequences captured in marine metagenomic datasets.  Using the bioinformatically-optimized primer pairs, dmdA genes were amplified from free-living coastal bacterioplankton samples and sequenced using 454 technology.  An average of 6,400 amplicons per primer pair represented almost 800 clusters of environmental dmdA sequences, with clusters defined conservatively at >90% nucleotide sequence identity (~95% protein identity).  Systematic comparisons of primer performance showed that degenerate and inosine-based primers did not perform better than specific primer sets in retrieving dmdA diversity, and sometimes captured a lower diversity of sequences from the same DNA sample.  The specific primer sets were used to compare dmdA diversity in free-living versus particle-associated bacteria in southeastern U.S. coastal waters.  Hundreds of different dmdA clusters were found in both size fractions, with Roseobacter-like and SAR11-like sequences dominating both. The free-living fraction had a higher diversity of dmdA clusters overall, though clusters retrieved by a given primer set were largely shared (52-88%) across the two size fractions, and most sequences were affiliated with these shared clusters (~90%). Despite evidence from 16S rRNA-based taxonomic surveys that free-living bacterioplankton are a considerably less diverse subset of particle-associated bacteria at this site, this seems not to be the case for a widespread bacterial gene mediating sulfur transformations.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which can preserve the signatures of present and past infections.

For photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes, the rate-limiting step in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation is its reduction to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), which is catalyzed by assimilatory nitrate reductase (NR). Oceanic productivity is primarily limited by available nitrogen and, although nitrate is the most abundant form of available nitrogen in oceanic waters, little is known about the identity of microbial eukaryotes that take up nitrate. This lack of knowledge is especially severe for ice-covered seas that are being profoundly affected by climate change. To address this, we examined the distribution and diversity of NR genes in the Arctic region by way of clone libraries and data mining of available metagenomes (total of 4.24 billion reads). We directly compared NR clone phylogenies with the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene (DNA pool) and 18S rRNA (RNA pool) at two ice-influenced stations in the Canada Basin (Beaufort Sea). The communities from the two nucleic acid templates were similar at the level of major groups, and species identified by way of NR gene phylogeny and microscopy were a subset of the 18S results. Most NR genes from arctic clone libraries matched diatoms and chromist nanoflagellates, including novel clades, while the NR genes in arctic eukaryote metagenomes were dominated by chlorophyte NR, in keeping with the ubiquitous occurrence of Mamiellophyceae in the Arctic Ocean. Overall, these data suggest that a dynamic and mixed eukaryotic community utilizes nitrate across the Arctic region, and they show the potential utility of NR as a tool to identify ongoing changes in arctic photosynthetic communities.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> To better understand the diversity of primary producers in the Arctic Ocean, we targeted a nitrogen cycle gene, NR, which is required for phytoplankton to assimilate nitrate into organic forms of nitrogen macromolecules. We compared this to the more detailed taxonomy from ice-influenced stations using a general taxonomic gene (18S rRNA). NR genes were ubiquitous and could be classified as belonging to diatoms, dinoflagellates, other flagellates, chlorophytes, and unknown microbial eukaryotes, suggesting novel diversity of both species and metabolism in arctic phytoplankton.

The enrichment cultures were made by inoculating the seawater/sediment slurry in marine minimal medium containing the polyester film as sole C source. Community composition and function was examined by metagenome/transcriptome analysis a)of the plastic biofilm/free-living fractions separately, b) after a starvation period (t0) and addition of new plastic substrate after one hour (t1), 24 hours (t2) and seven days (t3). In addition to the plastic film, the culture was grown on each monomer separately and metagenomes were analysed for each different growth condition.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	33188179	Synergistic biodegradation of aromatic-aliphatic copolyester plastic by a marine microbial consortium.	The degradation of synthetic polymers by marine microorganisms is not as well understood as the degradation of plastics in soil and compost. Here, we use metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to study the biodegradation of an aromatic-aliphatic copolyester blend by a marine microbial enrichment culture. The culture can use the plastic film as the sole carbon source, reaching maximum conversion to CO<sub>2</sub> and biomass in around 15 days. The consortium degrades the polymer synergistically, with different degradation steps being performed by different community members. We identify six putative PETase-like enzymes and four putative MHETase-like enzymes, with the potential to degrade aliphatic-aromatic polymers and their degradation products, respectively. Our results show that, although there are multiple genes and organisms with the potential to perform each degradation step, only a few are active during biodegradation.

Biogeochemical and microbiological data indicate that the anaerobic oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has an important role in carbon and sulfur cycling at marine seeps. Yet, little is known about the bacterial hydrocarbon degraders active in situ. Here, we provide the link between previous biogeochemical measurements and the cultivation of degraders by direct identification of SRB responsible for butane and dodecane degradation in complex on-site microbiota. Two contrasting seep sediments from Mediterranean Amon mud volcano and Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) were incubated with (13)C-labeled butane or dodecane under sulfate-reducing conditions and analyzed via complementary stable isotope probing (SIP) techniques. Using DNA- and rRNA-SIP, we identified four specialized clades of alkane oxidizers within Desulfobacteraceae to be distinctively active in oxidation of short- and long-chain alkanes. All clades belong to the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) clade, substantiating the crucial role of these bacteria in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation at marine seeps. The identification of key enzymes of anaerobic alkane degradation, subsequent Beta-oxidation and the reverse Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for complete substrate oxidation by protein-SIP further corroborated the importance of the DSS clade and indicated that biochemical pathways, analog to those discovered in the laboratory, are of great relevance for natural settings. The high diversity within identified subclades together with their capability to initiate alkane degradation and growth within days to weeks after substrate amendment suggest an overlooked potential of marine benthic microbiota to react to natural changes in seepage, as well as to massive hydrocarbon input, for example, as encountered during anthropogenic oil spills.

In deep-sea geothermal rift zones, the dispersal of hydrothermal fluids of moderately-high temperatures typically forms subseafloor mounds. Major mineral components of the crust covering the mound are barite and metal sulfides. As a result of the continental rifting along the Red Sea, metalliferous sediments accumulate on the seafloor of the Atlantis II Deep. In the present study, a barite crust was identified in a sediment core from the Atlantis II Deep, indicating the formation of a hydrothermal mound at the sampling site. Here, we examined how such a dense barite crust could affect the local environment and the distribution of microbial inhabitants. Our results demonstrate distinctive features of mineral components and microbial communities in the sediment layers separated by the barite crust. Within the mound, archaea accounted for 65% of the community. In contrast, the sediments above the barite boundary were overwhelmed by bacteria. The composition of microbial communities under the mound was similar to that in the sediments of the nearby Discovery Deep and marine cold seeps. This work reveals the zonation of microbial communities after the formation of the hydrothermal mound in the subsurface sediments of the rift basin.	26284035	Microbial community changes along the active seepage site of one cold seep in the Red Sea.	The active seepage of the marine cold seeps could be a critical process for the exchange of energy between the submerged geosphere and the sea floor environment through organic-rich fluids, potentially even affecting surrounding microbial habitats. However, few studies have investigated the associated microbial community changes. In the present study, 16S rRNA genes were pyrosequenced to decipher changes in the microbial communities from the Thuwal seepage point in the Red Sea to nearby marine sediments in the brine pool, normal marine sediments and water, and benthic microbial mats. An unexpected number of reads from unclassified groups were detected in these habitats; however, the ecological functions of these groups remain unresolved. Furthermore, ammonia-oxidizing archaeal community structures were investigated using the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene. Analysis of amoA showed that planktonic marine habitats, including seeps and marine water, hosted archaeal ammonia oxidizers that differed from those in microbial mats and marine sediments, suggesting modifications of the ammonia oxidizing archaeal (AOA) communities along the environmental gradient from active seepage sites to peripheral areas. Changes in the microbial community structure of AOA in different habitats (water vs. sediment) potentially correlated with changes in salinity and oxygen concentrations. Overall, the present results revealed for the first time unanticipated novel microbial groups and changes in the ammonia-oxidizing archaea in response to environmental gradients near the active seepages of a cold seep.

Microbial eukaryotes are found alongside bacteria and archaea in natural microbial systems, including host-associated microbiomes. While microbial eukaryotes are critical to these communities, they are challenging to study with shotgun sequencing techniques and are therefore often excluded. Here, we present EukDetect, a bioinformatics method to identify eukaryotes in shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. Our approach uses a database of 521,824 universal marker genes from 241 conserved gene families, which we curated from 3713 fungal, protist, non-vertebrate metazoan, and non-streptophyte archaeplastida genomes and transcriptomes. EukDetect has a broad taxonomic coverage of microbial eukaryotes, performs well on low-abundance and closely related species, and is resilient against bacterial contamination in eukaryotic genomes. Using EukDetect, we describe the spatial distribution of eukaryotes along the human gastrointestinal tract, showing that fungi and protists are present in the lumen and mucosa throughout the large intestine. We discover that there is a succession of eukaryotes that colonize the human gut during the first years of life, mirroring patterns of developmental succession observed in gut bacteria. By comparing DNA and RNA sequencing of paired samples from human stool, we find that many eukaryotes continue active transcription after passage through the gut, though some do not, suggesting they are dormant or nonviable. We analyze metagenomic data from the Baltic Sea and find that eukaryotes differ across locations and salinity gradients. Finally, we observe eukaryotes in Arabidopsis leaf samples, many of which are not identifiable from public protein databases. EukDetect provides an automated and reliable way to characterize eukaryotes in shotgun sequencing datasets from diverse microbiomes. We demonstrate that it enables discoveries that would be missed or clouded by false positives with standard shotgun sequence analysis. EukDetect will greatly advance our understanding of how microbial eukaryotes contribute to microbiomes.

MGYS00003946	Seyler North Atlantic water column	CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Predictability) is a core component of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). CLIVAR's objective, as stated on their website (www.clivar.org) is to describe and understand the ocean-atmosphere processes responsible for climate variability and predictability on seasonal, interannual, decadal, and centennial time-scales, through the collection and analysis of observations and the development and application of models of the coupled climate system, in cooperation with other relevant climate-research and observing activities. In April-May 2012, we participated in a research cruise as part of the US CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography program, onboard the UNOLS ships R/V Atlantis. The cruise was a repeat of World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) line A20 (longitude 52W), previously conducted in 2003. 10-L water samples were collected at a total of 83 stations at varying depth intervals, using a 36-Niskin bottle rosette. We took 0.5-1.0 L samples from the rosette roughly once per day at 16 stations throughout the cruise. At each station, water was taken from at least three distinct zones in the water column, based on data from the CTD: the middle of the mixed layer, the local oxygen minimum, and the middle of the bathypelagic zone. At 7 stations, samples were also drawn from the bottom-most bottle. Biomass was immediately collected on 0.2 um filters under vacuum filtration. SIP microcosms were set up at 13 stations using 13C sodium acetate, 13C urea, 13C sodium bicarbonate, 13C algal lipid/pigment extract, and 15N algal protein extract. The samples submitted to the Earth Microbiome Project represent T=0 time points for the SIP microcosms (before amendment) and extra samples taken for RNA/DNA analysis. Results from SIP are currently being processed.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

Understanding environment-community relationships under shifting environmental conditions helps uncover mechanisms by which environmental microbial communities manage to improve ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the microbial community and structure near the Yellow Sea River estuary in 12 stations across the middle of the Bohai Sea for over two seasons to elucidate the influence of estuarine output on them. We found that the dominant phyla in all stations were Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes. Alpha-diversity increased near the estuary and bacterial community structure differed with variation of spatiotemporal gradients. Among all the environmental factors surveyed, temperature, salinity, phosphate, silicon, nitrate, and total virioplankton abundance played crucial roles in controlling the bacterial community composition. Some inferred that community functions such as carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid metabolism, xenobiotics biodegradation, membrane transport, and environmental adaptation were much higher in winter; energy and nucleotide metabolism were lower in winter. Our results suggested that estuarine output had a great influence on the Bohai Sea environment and changes in the water environmental conditions caused by estuarine output developed distinctive microbial communities in the middle of the Bohai Sea. The distinctive microbial communities in winter demonstrated that the shifting water environment may stimulate changes in the diversity and then strengthen the predicted functions.

MGYS00004340	Aldegondabreen cryoconite Targeted Locus	The aggregation of surface debris (cryoconite) on melting glaciers into larger may provide microenvironments for various microorganisms and metabolic processes. Here we investigate the microbial community on the surface of Aldegondabreen, a valley glacier in Svalbard which is supplied with carbon and nutrients from different sources across its surface, including colonies of seabirds. We used a combination of geochemical analysis (surface debris, ice and meltwater), quantitative PCR (targeting the 16S rRNA and amoA genes), pyrosequencing and multivariate statistical analysis to better understand the ecology of prokaryotic microbes on the surface on Aldegondabreen and their role in nitrogen cycling. The combination of high nutrient input, supraglacial melt water flow and the presence of fine, claylike particles supports the formation of cmscale cryoconite aggregates in some areas of the glacier surface. We show that a diverse microbial community is present, dominated by the cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, that are wellknown in supraglacial environments. Allochthonous material including plant tissuederived chloroplasts was also identified in the molecular analysis. Importantly, ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) were detected in the aggregates for the first time on an Arctic glacier.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Ice:Glacier

Present-day terrestrial analogue sites are crucial ground truth proxies for studying life in geochemical conditions close to those assumed to be present on early Earth or inferred to exist on other celestial bodies (e.g. Mars, Europa). Although hypersaline sapropels are border-of-life habitats with moderate occurrence, their microbiological and physicochemical characterization lags behind. Here, we study the diversity of life under low water activity by describing the prokaryotic communities from two disparate hypersaline sapropels (Transylvanian Basin, Romania) in relation to geochemical milieu and pore water chemistry, while inferring their role in carbon cycling by matching taxa to known taxon-specific biogeochemical functions. The polyphasic approach combined deep coverage SSU rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics with RT-qPCR and physicochemical investigations. We found that sapropels developed an analogous elemental milieu and harbored prokaryotes affiliated with fifty-nine phyla, among which the most abundant were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi. Containing thirty-two candidate divisions and possibly undocumented prokaryotic lineages, the hypersaline sapropels were found to accommodate one of the most diverse and novel ecosystems reported to date and may contribute to completing the phylogenetic branching of the tree of life.

Subterranean estuaries extend inland into density-stratified coastal carbonate aquifers containing a surprising diversity of endemic animals (mostly crustaceans) within a highly oligotrophic habitat. How complex ecosystems (termed anchialine) thrive in this globally distributed, cryptic environment is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a microbial loop shuttles methane and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to higher trophic levels of the anchialine food web in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). Methane and DOC production and consumption within the coastal groundwater correspond with a microbial community capable of methanotrophy, heterotrophy, and chemoautotrophy, based on characterization by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and respiratory quinone composition. Fatty acid and bulk stable carbon isotope values of cave-adapted shrimp suggest that carbon from methanotrophic bacteria comprises 21% of their diet, on average. These findings reveal a heretofore unrecognized subterranean methane sink and contribute to our understanding of the carbon cycle and ecosystem function of karst subterranean estuaries.

General studies on benthic microbial communities focus on fundamental biogeochemical processes or the most abundant constituents. Thereby, minor fractions such as the <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> are frequently neglected. Even though this family belongs to the most widely distributed bacteria in the marine environment, their proportion on benthic microbial communities is usually within or below the single digit range. Thus, knowledge on these community members is limited, even though their absolute numbers might exceed those from the pelagic zone by orders of magnitudes. To unravel the distribution and diversity of benthic, metabolically active <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i>, we have now analyzed an already existing library of bacterial 16S rRNA transcripts. The dataset originated from 154 individual sediment samples comprising seven oceanic regions and a broad variety of environmental conditions. Across all samples, a total of 0.7% of all 16S rRNA transcripts was annotated as <i>Rhodobacteraceae.</i> Among those, <i>Sulfitobacter</i>, <i>Paracoccus</i>, and <i>Phaeomarinomonas</i> were the most abundant cultured representatives, but the majority (78%) was affiliated to uncultured family members. To define them, the 45 most abundant <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i>-OTUs assigned as "uncultured" were phylogenetically assembled in new clusters. Their next relatives particularly belonged to different subgroups other than the <i>Roseobacter</i> group, reflecting a large part of the hidden diversity within the benthic <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> with unknown functions. The general composition of active <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> communities was found to be specific for the geographical location, exhibiting a decreasing richness with sediment depth. One-third of the <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i>-OTUs significantly responded to the prevailing redox regime, suggesting an adaption to anoxic conditions. A possible approach to predict their physiological properties is to identify the metabolic capabilities of their nearest relatives. Those need to be proven by physiological experiments, as soon an isolate is available. Because many uncultured members of these subgroups likely thrive under anoxic conditions, in future research, a molecular-guided cultivation strategy can be pursued to isolate novel <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> from sediments.

Methane production by methanogens in mangrove sediments is known to contribute significantly to global warming, but studies on the shift of methanogenic community in response to anthropogenic contaminations were still limited. In this study, the effect of anthropogenic activities in the mangrove sediments along the north and south coastlines of Singapore were investigated by pyrosequencing of the mcrA gene. Our results showed that hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogens coexist in the sediments. The predominance of the methylotrophic Methanosarcinales reflects the potential for high methane production as well as the possible availability of low acetate and high methylated C-1 compounds as substrates. A decline in the number of acetoclastic/methylotrophic methanogens in favor of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was observed along a vertical profile in Sungei Changi, which was contaminated by heavy metals. The diversity of methanogens in the various contaminated stations was significantly different from that in a pristine St. John's Island. The spatial variation in the methanogenic communities among the different stations was more distinct than those along the vertical profiles at each station. We suggest that the overall heterogeneity of the methanogenic communities residing in the tropical mangrove sediments might be due to the accumulated effects of temperature and concentrations of nitrate, cobalt, and nickel.

Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes showed that Geobacter, Desulfuromonas, and Dehalococcoides populations grew significantly during the time PCE and TCE were converted to ethene. Most 16S rRNA sequences of Dehalococcoides spp. were phylogenetically close to known Dehalococcoides sp. strains, however about 10% of sequences were quite distant from the previously characterized Dehalococcoides sp.

MGYS00004046	Prokaryotic community structure in the deep Southwest Indian Ocean with an emphasis on actinobacteria Targeted Locus (Loci)	Knowledge about the biodiversity extent and biogeography of deep-sea microorganisms is far from adequate. Due to its remote location, the related investigations of the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIR) remaine extremely difficult and the microbial diversity at the SWIR has rarely been studied. Only two studies got limited numbers of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and much more in-depth sequencing efforts to evaluate the abundance and diversity of prokaryotes at the SWIR are still needed. In this study, pyrosequencing was used to investigate the community structure and biogeography of prokaryotes, especially actinobacteria, in the deep SWIR. It also identified the factors in contributing to the distribution of the prokaryotes and actinobacteria, the historical contingencies, contemporary environmental factors, or both? The results would provide further insights on the prokaryotic, especially actinobacterial community structure at the SWIR and help to understand the underling mechanisms of the microbial distribution in the deep ocean. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the biodiversity and biogeography of actinobacteria at the SWIR.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Oceanic:Sediment	27621725	Diversity, Biogeography, and Biodegradation Potential of Actinobacteria in the Deep-Sea Sediments along the Southwest Indian Ridge.	The phylum Actinobacteria has been reported to be common or even abundant in deep marine sediments, however, knowledge about the diversity, distribution, and function of actinobacteria is limited. In this study, actinobacterial diversity in the deep sea along the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) was investigated using both 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and culture-based methods. The samples were collected at depths of 1662-4000 m below water surface. Actinobacterial sequences represented 1.2-9.1% of all microbial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences in each sample. A total of 5 actinobacterial classes, 17 orders, 28 families, and 52 genera were detected by pyrosequencing, dominated by the classes Acidimicrobiia and Actinobacteria. Differences in actinobacterial community compositions were found among the samples. The community structure showed significant correlations to geochemical factors, notably pH, calcium, total organic carbon, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen, rather than to spatial distance at the scale of the investigation. In addition, 176 strains of the Actinobacteria class, belonging to 9 known orders, 18 families, and 29 genera, were isolated. Among these cultivated taxa, 8 orders, 13 families, and 15 genera were also recovered by pyrosequencing. At a 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the pyrosequencing data encompassed 77.3% of the isolates but the isolates represented only 10.3% of the actinobacterial reads. Phylogenetic analysis of all the representative actinobacterial sequences and isolates indicated that at least four new orders within the phylum Actinobacteria were detected by pyrosequencing. More than half of the isolates spanning 23 genera and all samples demonstrated activity in the degradation of refractory organics, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polysaccharides, suggesting their potential ecological functions and biotechnological applications for carbon recycling.

A next-generation sequencing, phylogeographic analysis.	This work set out to shed light on the phylogeography of the SAR11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria, which is probably the most abundant group of heterotrophic bacteria on Earth. In particular, we assessed the degree to which empirical evidence (environmental DNA sequences) supports the concept that SAR11 lineages evolve faster than they are dispersed thus generating vicariant distributions, as predicted by recent simulation efforts. We generated 16S rRNA gene sequences from surface seawater collected at the South West Atlantic Ocean and combined these data with previously published sequences from similar environments from elsewhere. Altogether, these data consisted in about 1e6 reads, from which we generated 355,306 high quality sequences of which 95,318 corresponded to SAR11. Quantitative phylogeographic analyses supported the existence of a spatially explicit distribution of SAR11 species and provided evidence in favor of the idea that dispersal limitations significantly contribute to SAR11 radiation throughout the world's oceans. Likewise, pairwise phylogenetic distances between the communities studied here were significantly correlated with the genetic divergences predicted by a previously proposed neutral model. As discussed in the paper, these findings are compatible with the concept that the ocean surface constitutes a homogeneous environment for SAR11, in agreement with previous experimental data. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis in a global change scenario. This is the first study combining high throughput sequencing and phylogenic analysis to study bacterial phylogeography and reporting a distance decay pattern of phylogenetic distances for bacteria.

Anthurium amnicola Dressler possesses a number of desirable and novel ornamental traits such as a purple-colored upright spathe, profuse flowering, and floral scent, some of which have been introgressed into modern Anthurium cultivars. As a first step in identifying genes associated with these traits, the transcriptome from root, leaf, spathe, and spadix from an accession of A. amnicola was assembled, resulting in 28,019 putative transcripts representing 19,458 unigenes. Genes involved in pigmentation, including those for the metabolism of chlorophyll and the biosynthesis of carotenoids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids were identified. The expression levels of one MYB transcription factor was highly correlated with naringenin 3-dioxygenase (F3H) and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) in leaves, whereas a bHLH transcription factor was highly correlated with flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase (F3'H) and a DFR in spathes, suggesting that these two transcription factors might regulate flavonoid and anthocyanin synthesis in A. amnicola.

MGYS00003855	Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria in marine environments: widespread occurrence but low diversity	The respiratory reduction of nitrate (denitrification) is acknowledged as the most important process that converts biologically available nitrogen to gaseous dinitrogen (N2) in marine ecosystems. Observations during the last decade, however, indicate that anaerobic ammonium oxidation by nitrite (anammox) may be an important pathway for N2 formation and N removal in coastal marine sediments and in anoxic water columns of the oceans (e.g. Hulth et al., 2005). For about a decade we have explored this mechanism during N mineralization by a wide range of biogeochemical and molecular tools including e.g. benthic flux measurements and high resolution imaging of solute distributions, 15N amendments (single and coupled additions of 15NH4+, 14NO3- and 15NO3-), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and qualitative and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (e.g. Brandsma et al., 2011; Schmid et al., 2007; Engstrom et al., 2005; Jetten et al., 2003). The present study focuses on benthic N-cycling in the deepest trough of a Swedish fjord where the anammox reaction contributes up to 79% of total N2 production. The relative importance of anammox for N2 release was directly correlated with a variety of biogeochemical parameters. The observed correlations indicated a competition between reductants for pore water nitrite during early diagenesis, and that additional factors (e.g. availability of Mn-oxides), superimposed on overall patterns of diagenetic activity, are important for determining absolute and relative rates of anammox in coastal marine sediments. Insight in the metagenome of the microbial community in this complex benthic environment would provide complementary and critical information to further understand N cycling in marine environments.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

Alterations in the target proteins of fluoroquinolones, especially in GyrA and ParC, are known to cause resistance. Here, we investigated environmental Escherichia communities to explore the possible link between the abundance of mutations, and the exposure to fluoroquinolones. Sediment samples were collected from a relatively pristine lake, up and downstream from a sewage treatment plant, and from several industrially polluted sites. The quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC were analyzed using amplicon sequencing of metagenomic DNA. Five non-synonymous substitutions were present in all samples, and all of these mutations have been previously linked to fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli. In GyrA, substitutions S83L and D87N were on average detected at frequencies of 86 and 32%, respectively, and 31% of all amplicons encoded both substitutions. In ParC, substitutions S80I, E84G, and E84V were detected in 42, 0.9, and 6.0% of the amplicons, respectively, and 6.5% encoded double substitutions. There was no significant correlation between the level of fluoroquinolone pollution and the relative abundance of resistance mutations, with the exception of the most polluted site, which showed the highest abundance of said substitutions in both genes.

MGYS00003869	A decade of seasonal dynamics and co-occurrences within freshwater bacterioplankton communities from eutrophic Lake Mendota, WI, USA	With an unprecedented decade-long time series from a temperate eutrophic lake, we analyzed bacterial and environmental co-occurrence networks to gain insight into seasonal dynamics at the community level. We found that (1) bacterial co-occurrence networks were non-random, (2) season explained the network complexity and (3) co-occurrence network complexity was negatively correlated with the underlying community diversity across different seasons. Network complexity was not related to the variance of associated environmental factors. Temperature and productivity may drive changes in diversity across seasons in temperate aquatic systems, much as they control diversity across latitude. While the implications of bacterioplankton network structure on ecosystem function are still largely unknown, network analysis, in conjunction with traditional multivariate techniques, continues to increase our understanding of bacterioplankton temporal dynamics.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lake	28966891	Ananke: temporal clustering reveals ecological dynamics of microbial communities.	Taxonomic markers such as the 16S ribosomal RNA gene are widely used in microbial community analysis. A common first step in marker-gene analysis is grouping genes into clusters to reduce data sets to a more manageable size and potentially mitigate the effects of sequencing error. Instead of clustering based on sequence identity, marker-gene data sets collected over time can be clustered based on temporal correlation to reveal ecologically meaningful associations. We present Ananke, a free and open-source algorithm and software package that complements existing sequence-identity-based clustering approaches by clustering marker-gene data based on time-series profiles and provides interactive visualization of clusters, including highlighting of internal OTU inconsistencies. Ananke is able to cluster distinct temporal patterns from simulations of multiple ecological patterns, such as periodic seasonal dynamics and organism appearances/disappearances. We apply our algorithm to two longitudinal marker gene data sets: faecal communities from the human gut of an individual sampled over one year, and communities from a freshwater lake sampled over eleven years. Within the gut, the segregation of the bacterial community around a food-poisoning event was immediately clear. In the freshwater lake, we found that high sequence identity between marker genes does not guarantee similar temporal dynamics, and Ananke time-series clusters revealed patterns obscured by clustering based on sequence identity or taxonomy. Ananke is free and open-source software available at https://github.com/beiko-lab/ananke.

Analysis of the genes and genomes present in Tara Oceans Polar Circle virus size fractions through shotgun DNA sequencing.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	32404515	Extreme Viral Partitioning in a Marine-Derived High Arctic Lake.	High-latitude, perennially stratified (meromictic) lakes are likely to be especially vulnerable to climate warming because of the importance of ice in maintaining their water column structure and associated distribution of microbial communities. This study aimed to characterize viral abundance, diversity, and distribution in a meromictic lake of marine origin on the far northern coast of Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian High Arctic. We collected triplicate samples for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viromics from five depths that encompassed the major features of the lake, as determined by limnological profiling of the water column. Viral abundance and virus-to-prokaryote ratios were highest at greater depths, while bacterial and cyanobacterial counts were greatest in the surface waters. The viral communities from each zone of the lake defined by salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations were markedly distinct, suggesting that there was little exchange of viral types among lake strata. Ten viral assembled genomes were obtained from our libraries, and these also segregated with depth. This well-defined structure of viral communities was consistent with that of potential hosts. Viruses from the monimolimnion, a deep layer of ancient Arctic Ocean seawater, were more diverse and relatively abundant, with few similarities to available viral sequences. The Lake A viral communities also differed from published records from the Arctic Ocean and meromictic Ace Lake in Antarctica. This first characterization of viral diversity from this sentinel environment underscores the microbial richness and complexity of an ecosystem type that is increasingly exposed to major perturbations in the fast-changing Arctic.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The Arctic is warming at an accelerating pace, and the rise in temperature has increasing impacts on the Arctic biome. Lakes are integrators of their surroundings and thus excellent sentinels of environmental change. Despite their importance in the regulation of key microbial processes, viruses remain largely uncharacterized in Arctic lacustrine environments. We sampled a highly stratified meromictic lake near the northern limit of the Canadian High Arctic, a region in rapid transition due to climate change. We found that the different layers of the lake harbored viral communities that were strikingly dissimilar and highly divergent from known viruses. Viruses were more abundant in the deepest part of the lake containing ancient Arctic Ocean seawater that was trapped during glacial retreat and were genomically unlike any viruses previously described. This research demonstrates the complexity and novelty of viral communities in an environment that is vulnerable to ongoing perturbation.

Microbial eukaryotes are increasingly being recognised for their role in global biogeochemical cycles, yet very few studies have focussed on their distribution in high-latitude stream sediments, an important habitat which influences stream water nutrient chemistry. In this study, we present the first comparison of microbial eukaryotes from two different polar habitats by determining the abundance and taxonomic affiliation of 18S rRNA gene fragments recovered from four sediment samples in Svalbard: two from a glaciated catchment and two from an unglaciated permafrost-dominated catchment. Whilst there was no difference between the two catchments in terms of Rao's phylogenetic diversity (0.18+/-0.04, 1SD), the glaciated catchment samples had slightly higher richness (138-139) than the unglaciated catchment samples (67-106). At the phylum level, Ciliophora had the highest relative abundance in the samples from the glaciated catchment (32-63%), but only comprised 0-17% of the unglaciated catchment samples. Bacillariophyta was the most abundant phylum in one of the samples from the unglaciated catchment (43%) but phototrophic microbial eukaryotes only formed a minor component of the glaciated catchment samples (&lt;2%), suggesting that in these environments the microbial eukaryotes are predominantly heterotrophic (chemotrophic). This is in contrast to previously published data from Robertson Glacier, Canada where the relative abundance of chlorophyta (phototrophs) in three samples was 48-57%. The contrast may be due to differences in glacial hydrology and/or geology, highlighting the variation in microbial eukaryote communities between nominally similar environments.

Extreme ecosystems such as hot springs are of great interest as a source of novel extremophilic species, enzymes, metabolic functions for survival and biotechnological products. India harbors hundreds of hot springs, the majority of which are not yet explored and require comprehensive studies to unravel their unknown and untapped phylogenetic and functional diversity. The aim of this study was to perform a large-scale metagenomic analysis of three major hot springs located in central India namely, Badi Anhoni, Chhoti Anhoni, and Tattapani at two geographically distinct regions (Anhoni and Tattapani), to uncover the resident microbial community and their metabolic traits. Samples were collected from seven distinct sites of the three hot spring locations with temperature ranging from 43.5 to 98C. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of V3 hypervariable region and shotgun metagenome sequencing uncovered a unique taxonomic and metabolic diversity of the resident thermophilic microbial community in these hot springs. Genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation pathways, such as benzoate, xylene, toluene, and benzene were observed to be abundant in the Anhoni hot springs (43.5-55C), dominated by <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i> and <i>Acidovorax</i> sp., suggesting the presence of chemoorganotrophic thermophilic community with the ability to utilize complex hydrocarbons as a source of energy. A high abundance of genes belonging to methane metabolism pathway was observed at Chhoti Anhoni hot spring, where methane is reported to constitute &gt;80% of all the emitted gases, which was marked by the high abundance of <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i>. The Tattapani hot spring, with a high-temperature range (61.5-98C), displayed a lower microbial diversity and was primarily dominated by a nitrate-reducing archaeal species <i>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</i>. A higher abundance of cell metabolism pathways essential for the microbial survival in extreme conditions was observed at Tattapani. Taken together, the results of this study reveal a novel consortium of microbes, genes, and pathways associated with the hot spring environment.

Dispersant application is a primary emergency oil spill response strategy and yet the efficacy and unintended consequences of this approach in marine ecosystems remain controversial. To address these uncertainties, <i>ex situ</i> incubations were conducted to quantify the impact of dispersant on petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) biodegradation rates and microbial community structure at as close as realistically possible to approximated <i>in situ</i> conditions [2 ppm v/v oil with or without dispersant, at a dispersant to oil ratio (DOR) of 1:15] in surface seawater. Biodegradation rates were not substantially affected by dispersant application at low mixing conditions, while under completely dispersed conditions, biodegradation was substantially enhanced, decreasing the overall half-life of total PHC compounds from 15.4 to 8.8 days. While microbial respiration and growth were not substantially altered by dispersant treatment, RNA analysis revealed that dispersant application resulted in pronounced changes to the composition of metabolically active microbial communities, and the abundance of nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes, as determined by qPCR of nitrogenase (<i>nifH</i>) genes, showed a large increase. While the <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> were enriched in all treatments, the <i>Betaproteobacteria</i> and different families of <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> predominated in the oil and dispersant treatment, respectively. Results show that mixing conditions regulate the efficacy of dispersant application in an oil slick, and the quantitative increase in the nitrogen-fixing microbial community indicates a selection pressure for nitrogen fixation in response to a readily biodegradable, nitrogen-poor substrate.

MGYS00004526	Bacterial Biomarkers of Marcellus Shale Activity in Pennsylvania	The goal of this study were to determine how hydraulic fracturing impacts bacteria in nearby streams by analyzing 16S rRNA data. Overall diversity and interactions among bacteria were examined to see how hydraulic fracturing may impact bacterial communities. Analysis was also done to identify pathways that were potentially enriched in streams near hydraulic fracturing and taxa that could be potential biomarkers for impacted streams. Therefore, this study generated data that increase our understanding of how hydraulic fracturing affects the surrounding environment.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lotic:Sediment	30116227	Bacterial Biomarkers of Marcellus Shale Activity in Pennsylvania.	Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) extraction, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is becoming more prevalent with the increasing use and demand for natural gas; however, the full extent of its environmental impacts is still unknown. Here we measured physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition of sediment samples taken from twenty-eight streams within the Marcellus shale formation in northeastern Pennsylvania differentially impacted by hydraulic fracturing activities. Fourteen of the streams were classified as UOG+, and thirteen were classified as UOG- based on the presence of UOG extraction in their respective watersheds. One stream was located in a watershed that previously had UOG extraction activities but was recently abandoned. We utilized high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to infer differences in sediment aquatic bacterial community structure between UOG+ and UOG- streams, as well as correlate bacterial community structure to physicochemical water parameters. Although overall alpha and beta diversity differences were not observed, there were a plethora of significantly enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within UOG+ and UOG- samples. Our biomarker analysis revealed many of the bacterial taxa enriched in UOG+ streams can live in saline conditions, such as Rubrobacteraceae. In addition, several bacterial taxa capable of hydrocarbon degradation were also enriched in UOG+ samples, including Oceanospirillaceae. Methanotrophic taxa, such as Methylococcales, were significantly enriched as well. Several taxa that were identified as enriched in these samples were enriched in samples taken from different streams in 2014; moreover, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed clustering between streams from the different studies based on the presence of hydraulic fracturing along the second axis. This study revealed significant differences between bacterial assemblages within stream sediments of UOG+ and UOG- streams and identified several potential biomarkers for evaluating and monitoring the response of autochthonous bacterial communities to potential hydraulic fracturing impacts.

Microbes are central to the structuring and functioning of marine ecosystems. Given the remarkable diversity of the ocean microbiome, uncovering marine microbial taxa remains a fundamental challenge in microbial ecology. However, there has been little effort, thus far, to describe the diversity of marine microorganisms in the region of high marine biodiversity around the Philippines. Here, we present data on the taxonomic diversity of bacteria and archaea in Benham Rise, Philippines, Western Pacific Ocean, using 16S V4 rRNA gene sequencing. The major bacterial and archaeal phyla identified in the Benham Rise are Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Marinimicrobia, Thaumarchaeota and, Euryarchaeota. The upper mesopelagic layer exhibited greater microbial diversity and richness compared to surface waters. Vertical zonation of the microbial community is evident and may be attributed to physical stratification of the water column acting as a dispersal barrier. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) recapitulated previously known associations of taxa and physicochemical parameters in the environment, such as the association of oligotrophic clades with low nutrient surface water and deep water clades that have the capacity to oxidize ammonia or nitrite at the upper mesopelagic layer. These findings provide foundational information on the diversity of marine microbes in Philippine waters. Further studies are warranted to gain a more comprehensive picture of microbial diversity within the region.

Drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) harbor the microorganisms in biofilms and suspended communities, yet the diversity and spatiotemporal distribution have been studied mainly in the suspended communities. This study examined the diversity of biofilms in an urban DWDS, its relationship with suspended communities and its dynamics. The studied DWDS in Urbana, Illinois received conventionally treated and disinfected water sourced from the groundwater. Over a 2-year span, biomass were sampled from household water meters (n=213) and tap water (n=20) to represent biofilm and suspended communities, respectively. A positive correlation between operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance and occupancy was observed. Examined under a 'core-satellite' model, the biofilm community comprised 31 core populations that encompassed 76.7% of total 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequences. The biofilm communities shared with the suspended community highly abundant and prevalent OTUs, which related to methano-/methylotrophs (i.e., Methylophilaceae and Methylococcaceae) and aerobic heterotrophs (Sphingomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae), yet differed by specific core populations and lower diversity and evenness. Multivariate tests indicated seasonality as the main contributor to community structure variation. This pattern was resilient to annual change and correlated to the cyclic fluctuations of core populations. The findings of a distinctive biofilm community assemblage and methano-/methyltrophic primary production provide critical insights for developing more targeted water quality monitoring programs and treatment strategies for groundwater-sourced drinking water systems.

Bacteria are fundamental players in the functioning of the ocean, yet relatively little is known about the diversity of bacterioplankton assemblages and the factors shaping their spatial distribution. We investigated the diversity and community composition of bacterioplankton in surface waters of the Southern Adriatic sub-basin (SAd) in the Mediterranean Sea, across an environmental gradient from coastal to offshore stations. Bacterioplankton diversity was investigated using a whole-assemblage genetic fingerprinting technique (Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, ARISA) coupled with 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing. The main physico-chemical variables showed clear differences between coastal and offshore stations, with the latter displaying generally higher temperature, salinity and oxygen content. Bacterioplankton richness was higher in coastal than offshore waters. Bacterial community composition (BCC) differed significantly between coastal and offshore waters, and appeared to be influenced by temperature (explaining up to 30% of variance) and by the trophic state. Pyrosequencing evidenced dominance of Alphaproteobacteria (SAR11 cluster), uncultured Gammaproteobacteria (Rhodobacteraceae) and Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus). Members of the Bacteroidetes phylum were also abundant, and accounted for 25% in the station characterized by the higher organic carbon availability. Bacterioplankton assemblages included a few dominant taxa and a very large proportion (85%) of rare (&lt;0.1%) bacteria, the vast majority of which was unique to each sampling station. The first detailed census of bacterioplankton taxa in the SAd sub-basin, performed using next generation sequencing, indicates that assemblages are highly heterogeneous, spatially structured according to the environmental conditions, and comprise a large number of rare taxa. The high turnover diversity, particularly evident at the level of the rare taxa, suggests to direct future investigations toward larger spatial or temporal scales, to better understand the role of bacterioplankton in the ecosystem functioning and the biogeochemistry of the basin.

MGYS00003814	Prokaryote populations of extant microbialites along a depth gradient in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia, Canada	The Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP) is an international, multi-disciplinary, science and exploration effort to explain the origin of freshwater microbialites in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Fossil microbialites represent some of the earliest remnants of life on ancient Earth, and were common from ~2.5 billion to 540 million years ago. Today, microbialites are found in environments where conditions are often too harsh for most organisms. However, the microbialites in both Pavilion and Kelly lakes have provided a new environment for the scientific community to study. These lakes demonstrate that large and uniquely shaped structures can also occur in non-extreme environments that also support fish, plants and other species. The microbialites of these modern lakes are relevant to our understanding of ancient microbiaites that were once common and diverse on early Earth, as such, Pavilion Lake has become an exciting field site for Earth scientists and astrobiologists who are interested in the application of the PLRP research to the search for life in our solar system and beyond. The PLRP was founded in 2004, and has grown in exciting new directions ever since. During the 2004 field season, PLRP scientists discovered microbialites in Kelly Lake, which is approximately 20 km NW from Pavilion Lake. The PLRP team will be taking their DeepWorker Science and Exploration (DSE) program to Kelly Lake in 2011. These research activities complement those that have taken place at Pavilion Lake since 2008, and will help to broaden our understanding of modern microbialite-rich environments. Further to these science activities, the PLRP supports a thriving human exploration research component. The focus of this program element is the development of operational technologies and strategies that facilitate scientific productivity and efficiency for future human scientific exploration of our Solar System.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lake	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

Our three cenotes differ by depth (20-150 m), the amount carbon input from organic matter, light input, and proximity to the coast (increased influence from marine as well as anthropogenic sources). We have samples from the cenotes Xcolac, Calica and the hotel well from both dry and rainy seasons. In addition, we have dry season sediment samples from cenotes Xcolac and Calica.	root:Environmental:Aquatic	33252655	Dadasnake, a Snakemake implementation of DADA2 to process amplicon sequencing data for microbial ecology.

MGYS00004013	atmospheric depositon effect on bacterial diversity	Atmospheric inputs from mineral and anthropogenic sources are nowadays increasing globally due to desertification in one hand and industrialization on the other. In this context, it is important to understand how atmospheric particles can favor the growth of certain bacterioplankton groups of the ocean over others, as these changes will affect the ratio between primary and heterotrophic production, and consequently the concentration of atmospheric carbon that can be fixed (or released) in the surface layer of the ocean. As aerosol composition varies seasonally and locally, we evaluated the effect of both types of atmospheric particles on different locations of the northwestern Mediterranean and at different times of the year.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

We will test the following hypotheses:1. The subsurface microbial communities in the Hiolo area and Spillway area have different compositions that are related to local fluid chemistry, and2. The dominant species in microbial mats at Loihi Seamount are seeded by subsurface populations present in diffuse flow fluids. It is likely that the dominant mat species are present but not dominant in the subsurface, and bloom in the transition zone at the seafloor where warm, reduced anoxic fluids mingle with cool,oxic seawater.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Hydrothermal vents:Microbial mats

MGYS00004564	Marine DNA/RNA samples from Western English Channel site L4	Marine DNA/RNA samples from Western English Channel site L4.   The seasonal structure of microbial communities in the Western English Channel - 2007   Here we present a multi-omic study of the Bacterial and Archaeal diversity found at the L4 long-term marine observatory.  We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice.  Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008.  This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB).  These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) samples.  In addition, the August samples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals.  Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level.   Analysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn.  First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness.  Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer.  Fourth, despite the diversity of these communities, night and day samples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues.  When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between samples across seasons.  This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future.   In summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site.  The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	19659500	The seasonal structure of microbial communities in the Western English Channel	Very few marine microbial communities are well characterized even with the weight of research effort presently devoted to it. Only a small proportion of this effort has been aimed at investigating temporal community structure. Here we present the first report of the application of high-throughput pyrosequencing to investigate intra-annual bacterial community structure. Microbial diversity was determined for 12 time points at the surface of the L4 sampling site in the Western English Channel. This was performed over 11 months during 2007. A total of 182 560 sequences from the V6 hyper-variable region of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) were obtained; there were between 11 327 and 17 339 reads per sample. Approximately 7000 genera were identified, with one in every 25 reads being attributed to a new genus; yet this level of sampling far from exhausted the total diversity present at any one time point. The total data set contained 17 673 unique sequences. Only 93 (0.5%) were found at all time points, yet these few lineages comprised 50% of the total reads sequenced. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria (50% of all sequenced reads), while the SAR11 clade comprised 21% of the ubiquitous reads and approximately 12% of the total sequenced reads. In contrast, 78% of all operational taxonomic units were only found at one time point and 67% were only found once, evidence of a large and transient rare assemblage. This time series shows evidence of seasonally structured community diversity. There is also evidence for seasonal succession, primarily reflecting changes among dominant taxa. These changes in structure were significantly correlated to a combination of temperature, phosphate and silicate concentrations.																																													
MGYS00004593	Ammonia monooxygenase biogeography and sequence diversity in the Cape Fear Estuary	This project is focused on exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of microbes involved in nitrification within the sediments of the Cape Fear Estuary. 454 Sequencing of both bacterial and archaeal amoA genes was conducted with DNA extracts obtained from estaurine surface sediment samples. Spatial patterns were evaluated by collecting sediment along the salinity gradient of the estuary. Temporal patterns were evaluated by collecting sediment samples seasonal over a three year period. The interaction of community composition with environmental conditions was evaluated using in situ sediment transplant experiments within the estuary, where sediment bundles were moved from one location in the estuary to another and changes in the microbial community were observed over time following transplantation. These data are relevant to understanding the diversity and distribution of microbes involved in microbial nitrogen cycling and how the diversity of these functional groups interact with environmental conditions within an estuary.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Estuary:Sediment																																																
MGYS00004539	Seawater metagenome Targeted loci environmental	Red conger eel (Genypterus chilensis, Guichenot) is a native Chilean species whose meat is characterized by high gastronomic demand and is now part of the Chilean aquaculture diversification program. Two disease outbreaks derived from its intensified aquaculture farming have been reported and were associated with Vibrio spp. and Tenacibaculum spp. However, the role of individual species is not clear because there is a lack of information about the bacterial community composition associated with the rearing environment of healthy specimens of this fish species. This study examined the microbial community in the seawater of a G. chilensis aquaculture facility using both culture-based methods and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4V5 region using Illumina MiSeq.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Aquaculture	32570967	Microbial Communities Associated with Farmed <i>Genypterus chilensis</i>: Detection in Water Prior to Bacterial Outbreaks Using Culturing and High-Throughput Sequencing.	The red conger eel (<i>Genypterus chilensis</i>, Guichenot) is a native species included in the Chilean Aquaculture Diversification Program due to high commercial demand. In the context of intensified farming, prior reports link two disease outbreaks with emerging pathogens in the <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Tenacibaculum</i> genera. However, the roles remain unclear for the bacterial community and each specific bacterium is associated with the rearing environment for healthy specimens. The success of red conger eel farming therefore warrants research into the bacterial composition of aquaculture conditions and the antimicrobial susceptibilities thereof. This study used culturing methods and high-throughput sequencing to describe the bacterial community associated with water in which <i>G. chilensis</i> was farmed. With culturing methods, the predominant genera were <i>Vibrio</i> (21.6%), <i>Pseudolteromonas</i> (15.7%), <i>Aliivibrio</i> (13.7%), and <i>Shewanella</i> (7.8%). Only a few bacterial isolates showed amylase, gelatinase, or lipase activity, and almost all showed inhibition zones to commonly-used antibiotics in aquaculture. By contrast, high-throughput sequencing established <i>Paraperlucidibaca</i>, <i>Colwellia</i>, <i>Polaribacter</i>, <i>Saprospiraceae</i>, and <i>Tenacibaculum</i> as the predominant genera, with <i>Vibrio</i> ranking twenty-seventh in abundance. High-throughput sequencing also established a link between previous outbreaks with increased relative abundances of <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Tenacibaculum</i>. Therefore, monitoring the presence and abundance of these potential pathogens could be useful in providing prophylactic measures to prevent future outbreaks.

Traditionally, microbial surveys investigating the effect of chronic anthropogenic pressure such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminations consider just the alpha and beta diversity and ignore the interactions among the different taxa forming the microbial community. Here, we investigated the ecological relationships between the three domains of life (i.e., <i>Bacteria, Archaea</i>, and <i>Eukarya</i>) using 454 pyrosequencing on the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes from chronically impacted and pristine sediments, along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea (Gulf of Lion, Vermillion coast, Corsica, Bizerte lagoon and Lebanon) and the French Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay and English Channel). Our approach provided a robust ecological framework for the partition of the taxa abundance distribution into 859 core Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 6629 satellite OTUs. OTUs forming the core microbial community showed the highest sensitivity to changes in environmental and contaminant variations, with salinity, latitude, temperature, particle size distribution, total organic carbon (TOC) and PAH concentrations as main drivers of community assembly. The core communities were dominated by <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> for <i>Bacteria</i>, by <i>Thaumarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota</i> and <i>Thermoplasmata</i> for <i>Archaea</i> and <i>Metazoa</i> and <i>Dinoflagellata</i> for <i>Eukarya</i>. In order to find associations among microorganisms, we generated a co-occurrence network in which PAHs were found to impact significantly the potential predator - prey relationship in one microbial consortium composed of ciliates and <i>Actinobacteria</i>. Comparison of network topological properties between contaminated and non-contaminated samples showed substantial differences in the network structure and indicated a higher vulnerability to environmental perturbations in the contaminated sediments.	27594854	Chronic Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) Contamination Is a Marginal Driver for Community Diversity and Prokaryotic Predicted Functioning in Coastal Sediments.	Benthic microorganisms are key players in the recycling of organic matter and recalcitrant compounds such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coastal sediments. Despite their ecological importance, the response of microbial communities to chronic PAH pollution, one of the major threats to coastal ecosystems, has received very little attention. In one of the largest surveys performed so far on coastal sediments, the diversity and composition of microbial communities inhabiting both chronically contaminated and non-contaminated coastal sediments were investigated using high-throughput sequencing on the 18S and 16S rRNA genes. Prokaryotic alpha-diversity showed significant association with salinity, temperature, and organic carbon content. The effect of particle size distribution was strong on eukaryotic diversity. Similarly to alpha-diversity, beta-diversity patterns were strongly influenced by the environmental filter, while PAHs had no influence on the prokaryotic community structure and a weak impact on the eukaryotic community structure at the continental scale. However, at the regional scale, PAHs became the main driver shaping the structure of bacterial and eukaryotic communities. These patterns were not found for PICRUSt predicted prokaryotic functions, thus indicating some degree of functional redundancy. Eukaryotes presented a greater potential for their use as PAH contamination biomarkers, owing to their stronger response at both regional and continental scales.

In an effort to identify microbial communities with superior performances in the carboxylate platform for biofuel and high value chemical production, we screened 501 microbial communities from 77 sites across the continental U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico as inocula. From the best performing communities, we collected >1800 individual isolates by culturing with a variety of media and oxygen conditions. We generated draft genome sequence for 64 of the isolates, selected based on phylogenetic, ecological, and phenotypic variation. These sequences will be used to advance a system to study 1) the role of diversity in functional types within carboxylate platform fermentation communities, 2) the genetic basis for superior performance in these fermentations and 3) the basis of adaptation to extreme conditions.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Thermal springs:Hot (42-90C)	24502857	Evaluating the performance of carboxylate platform fermentations across diverse inocula originating as sediments from extreme environments.	To test the hypothesis that microbial communities from saline and thermal sediment environments are pre-adapted to exhibit superior fermentation performances, 501 saline and thermal samples were collected from a wide geographic range. Each sediment sample was screened as inoculum in a 30-day batch fermentation. Using multivariate statistics, the capacity of each community was assessed to determine its ability to degrade a cellulosic substrate and produce carboxylic acids in the context of the inoculum sediment chemistry. Conductance of soils was positively associated with production of particular acids, but negatively associated with conversion efficiency. In situ sediment temperature and conversion efficiency were consistently positively related. Because inoculum characteristics influence carboxylate platform productivity, optimization of the inoculum is an important and realistic goal.	22761870	Mesophilic and thermophilic conditions select for unique but highly parallel microbial communities to perform carboxylate platform biomass conversion.	The carboxylate platform is a flexible, cost-effective means of converting lignocellulosic materials into chemicals and liquid fuels. Although the platform's chemistry and engineering are well studied, relatively little is known about the mixed microbial communities underlying its conversion processes. In this study, we examined the metagenomes of two actively fermenting platform communities incubated under contrasting temperature conditions (mesophilic 40C; thermophilic 55 C), but utilizing the same inoculum and lignocellulosic feedstock. Community composition segregated by temperature. The thermophilic community harbored genes affiliated with Clostridia, Bacilli, and a Thermoanaerobacterium sp, whereas the mesophilic community metagenome was composed of genes affiliated with other Clostridia and Bacilli, Bacteriodia, Gamma-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Although both communities were able to metabolize cellulosic materials and shared many core functions, significant differences were detected with respect to the abundances of multiple Pfams, COGs, and enzyme families. The mesophilic metagenome was enriched in genes related to the degradation of arabinose and other hemicellulose-derived oligosaccharides, and the production of valerate and caproate. In contrast, the thermophilic community was enriched in genes related to the uptake of cellobiose and the transfer of genetic material. Functions assigned to taxonomic bins indicated that multiple community members at either temperature had the potential to degrade cellulose, cellobiose, or xylose and produce acetate, ethanol, and propionate. The results of this study suggest that both metabolic flexibility and functional redundancy contribute to the platform's ability to process lignocellulosic substrates and are likely to provide a degree of stability to the platform's fermentation processes.	22705541	Comparison of mixed-acid fermentations inoculated with six different mixed cultures.	The MixAlco(TM) process biologically converts biomass to carboxylate salts that may be converted to a variety of chemicals and fuels. This study examines the fermentation performance of six different mixed cultures, and how the performance was affected by the bacterial composition of each community. All six countercurrent fermentations had very similar performance, but were dissimilar in microbial community composition. The acid concentrations varied by only 12% between fermentation trains and the conversions varied only by 6%. The microbial communities were profiled using 16S rRNA tag-pyrosequencing, which revealed the presence of dynamic communities that were dominated by bacteria resembling Clostridia, but they shared few taxa in common. Yue-Clayton similarity calculations of the communities revealed that they were extremely different. The presence of different but functionally similar microbial communities in this study suggests that it is the operating parameters that determine the fermentation end-products.	21199196	Microbial community composition and dynamics in a semi-industrial-scale facility operating under the MixAlco™ bioconversion platform.	To monitor microbial community dynamics in a semi-industrial-scale lignocellulosic biofuel reactor system and to improve our understanding of the microbial communities involved in the MixAlco(TM) biomass conversion process. Reactor microbial communities were characterized at six time points over the course of an 80-day, mesophilic, semi-industrial-scale fermentation using community qPCR and 16S rRNA tag-pyrosequencing. We found the communities to be dynamic, bacterially dominated consortia capable of changing quickly in response to reactor conditions. Clostridia- and Bacteroidetes-like organisms dominated the reactor communities, but ultimately the communities established consortia containing complementary functional capacities for the degradation of lignocellulosic materials. Eighteen operational taxonomic units were found to share strong correlations with reactor acid concentration and may represent taxa integral to fermentor performance. The results of this study indicate that the emergence of complementary functional classes within the fermentor consortia may be a trait that is consistent across scales, and they suggest that there may be flexibility with respect to the specific identities of the organisms involved in the fermentor's degradation and fermentation processes. This study provides new information regarding the composition, dynamics and potential flexibility of the microbial communities associated with the MixAlco(TM) process and is likely to inform the improvement of this and other applications that employ mixed microbial communities.	20676626	Structure and dynamics of the microbial communities underlying the carboxylate platform for biofuel production.	The carboxylate platform utilizes a mixed microbial community to convert lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals and fuels. While much of the platform is well understood, little is known about its microbiology. Mesophilic (40 degrees C) and thermophilic (55 degrees C) fermentations employing a sorghum feedstock and marine sediment inoculum were profiled using 16S rRNA tag-pyrosequencing over the course of a 30-day incubation. The contrasting fermentation temperatures converted similar amounts of biomass, but the mesophilic community was significantly more productive, and the two temperatures differed significantly with respect to propionic and butyric acid production. Pyrotag sequencing revealed the presence of dynamic communities that responded rapidly to temperature and changed substantially over time. Both temperatures were dominated by bacteria resembling Clostridia, but they shared few taxa in common. The species-rich mesophilic community harbored a variety of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and gamma-Proteobacteria, whereas the thermophilic community was composed mainly of Clostridia and Bacilli. Despite differences in composition and productivity, similar patterns of functional class dynamics were observed. Over time, organisms resembling known cellulose degraders decreased in abundance, while organisms resembling known xylose degraders increased. Improved understanding of the carboxylate platform's microbiology will help refine platform performance and contribute to our growing knowledge regarding biomass conversion and biofuel production processes.

Indicator organisms and antibiotic resistance were used as a proxy to measure microbial water quality of ballast tanks of ships, and surface waters in a tropical harbor. The survival of marine bacteria in ballast tanks appeared to diminish over longer water retention time, with a reduction of cell viability observed after a week based on heterotrophic plate counts. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed distinct differences in microbial composition of ballast and harbor waters. The harbor waters had a higher abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.) and Alfa-proteobacteria (SAR11 members), while marine hydrocarbon degraders such as Gamma-proteobacteria (Ocenspirillaes spp., Thiotrchales spp.) and Bacteroidetes (Flavobacteriales spp.) dominated the ballast water samples. Screening of indicator organisms found Escherichia coli (E. coli), Enterococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) in two or more of the ballast and harbor water samples tested. Vibrio spp. and Salmonella spp. were detected exclusively in harbor water samples. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we screened for 13 antibiotic resistant gene (ARG) targets and found higher abundances of sul1 (4.13-3.44 x 102 copies/mL), dfrA (0.77-1.80 x10 copies/mL) and cfr (2.00-5.21 copies/mL) genes compared to the other ARG targets selected for this survey. These genes encode for resistance to sulfonamides, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol-florfenicol antibiotics, which are also known to persist in sediments of aquaculture farms and coastal environments. Among the ARGs screened, we found significant correlations (P&lt;0.05) between ereA, ermG, cfr and tetO genes to one or more of the indicator organisms detected in this study, which may suggest that these members contribute to the environmental resistome. This study provides a baseline water quality survey, quantitatively assessing indicators of antibiotic resistance, potentially pathogenic organisms and a broad-brush description of difference in microbial composition and diversity between open oceans and tropical coastal environments through the use of next generation sequencing technology.

We assessed the diversity and distribution of fungi in 13 water samples collected from four aquatic environments (stream, pond, melting ice water, and estuary) in the Ny-Aalesund Region, Svalbard (High Arctic) using 454 pyrosequencing with fungi-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Aquatic fungal communities in this region showed high diversity, with a total of 43,061 reads belonging to 641 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 200 belonged to Ascomycota, 196 to Chytridiomycota, 120 to Basidiomycota, 13 to Glomeromycota, and 10 to early diverging fungal lineages (traditional Zygomycota), whereas 102 belonged to unknown fungi. The major orders were Helotiales, Eurotiales, and Pleosporales in Ascomycota; Chytridiales and Rhizophydiales in Chytridiomycota; and Leucosporidiales and Sporidiobolales in Basidiomycota. The common fungal genera Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Epicoccum, Glaciozyma, Holtermanniella, Betamyces, and Phoma were identified. Interestingly, the four aquatic environments in this region harbored different aquatic fungal communities. Salinity, conductivity, and temperature were important factors in determining the aquatic fungal diversity and community composition. The results suggest the presence of diverse fungal communities and a considerable number of potentially novel fungal species in Arctic aquatic environments, which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological and evolutionary responses of fungi to climate change in the Arctic ecosystem.

Microbial eukaryotes in these lakes occupy a variety of trophic levels within the simple aquatic food web ranging from primary producers to tertiary predators. Here, we report the first molecular study to describe the vertical distribution of the eukaryotic community residing in the photic zone of the east lobe (ELB) and west lobe (WLB) of the chemically stratified Lake Bonney. The 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) libraries revealed vertically stratified populations dominated by photosynthetic protists, with a cryptophyte dominating shallow populations (ELB-6m; WLB-10m), a haptophyte occupying mid-depths (both lobes 13m) and chlorophytes residing in the deepest layers (ELB-18 and 20m; WLB-15 and 20m) of the photic zone. A previously undetected stramenopile occurred throughout the water column of both lobes. Temporal variation in the eukaryotic populations was examined during the transition from Antarctic summer (24-h sunlight) to polar night (complete dark).

The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica harbor numerous permanently ice-covered lakes, which provide a year-round oasis for microbial life. Microbial eukaryotes in these lakes occupy a variety of trophic levels within the simple aquatic food web ranging from primary producers to tertiary predators. Here, we report the first molecular study to describe the vertical distribution of the eukaryotic community residing in the photic zone of the east lobe (ELB) and west lobe (WLB) of the chemically stratified Lake Bonney. The 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) libraries revealed vertically stratified populations dominated by photosynthetic protists, with a cryptophyte dominating shallow populations (ELB-6 m; WLB-10 m), a haptophyte occupying mid-depths (both lobes 13 m) and chlorophytes residing in the deepest layers (ELB-18 and 20 m; WLB-15 and 20 m) of the photic zone. A previously undetected stramenopile occurred throughout the water column of both lobes. Temporal variation in the eukaryotic populations was examined during the transition from Antarctic summer (24-h sunlight) to polar night (complete dark). Protist diversity was similar between the two lobes of Lake Bonney due to exchange between the photic zones of the two basins via a narrow bedrock sill.

Lake sediments not only store the long-term ecological information including pollen and microfossils but are also a source of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA). Here, by the combination of traditional multi-proxy paleolimnological methods with the whole-metagenome shotgun-sequencing of sedDNA we were able to paint a comprehensive picture of the fluctuations in trophy and bacterial diversity and metabolism of a small temperate lake in response to hemp retting, across the past 2000 years. Hemp retting (HR), a key step in hemp fibre production, was historically carried out in freshwater reservoirs and had a negative impact on the lake ecosystems. In Lake Slone, we identified two HR events, during the late stage of the Roman and Early Medieval periods and correlated these to the increased trophy and imbalanced lake microbiome. The metagenomic analyses showed a higher abundance of Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes and a functional shift towards anaerobic metabolism, including degradation of complex biopolymers such as pectin and cellulose, during HR episodes. The lake eutrophication during HR was linked to the allochthonous, rather than autochthonous carbon supply-hemp straws. We also showed that the identification of HR based on the palynological analysis of hemp pollen may be inconclusive and we suggest the employment of the fibre count analysis as an additional and independent proxy.

Proteins and peptides are key components of the labile dissolved organic matter pool in marine environments. Knowing which types of bacteria metabolize peptides can inform the factors that govern peptide decomposition and further carbon and nitrogen remineralization in marine environments. A <sup>13</sup>C-labeled tetrapeptide, alanine-valine-phenylalanine-alanine (AVFA), was added to both surface (normoxic) and bottom (hypoxic) seawater from a coastal station in the northern Gulf of Mexico for a 2-day incubation experiment, and bacteria that incorporated the peptide were identified using DNA stable isotope probing (SIP). The decomposition rate of AVFA in the bottom hypoxic seawater (0.018-0.035 myM h<sup>-1</sup>) was twice as fast as that in the surface normoxic seawater (0.011-0.017 myM h<sup>-1</sup>). SIP experiments indicated that incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C was highest among the Flavobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, Verrucomicrobiae, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria in surface waters. In contrast, highest <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment was mainly observed in several Alphaproteobacteria (<i>Thalassococcus, Rhodobacteraceae, Ruegeria</i>) and Gammaproteobacteria genera (<i>Colwellia, Balneatrix, Thalassomonas</i>) in the bottom water. These data suggest that a more diverse group of both oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria may be involved in metabolizing labile organic matter such as peptides in normoxic coastal waters, and several copiotrophic genera belonging to Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and known to be widely distributed may contribute to faster peptide decomposition in the hypoxic waters.

Chemosynthetic mats involved in cycling sulfur compounds are often found in hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and whale falls. However, there are only few records of wood fall mats, even though the presence of hydrogen sulfide at the wood surface should create a perfect niche for sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Here we report the growth of microbial mats on wood incubated under conditions that simulate the Mediterranean deep-sea temperature and darkness. We used amplicon and metagenomic sequencing combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization to test whether a microbial succession occurs during mat formation and whether the wood fall mats present chemosynthetic features. We show that the wood surface was first colonized by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Arcobacter genus after only 30 days of immersion. Subsequently, the number of sulfate reducers increased and the dominant Arcobacter phylotype changed. The ecological succession was reflected by a change in the metabolic potential of the community from chemolithoheterotrophs to potential chemolithoautotrophs. Our work provides clear evidence for the chemosynthetic nature of wood fall ecosystems and demonstrates the utility to develop experimental incubation in the laboratory to study deep-sea chemosynthetic mats.

The phylogenetic composition of the heterotrophic microbial community is depth stratified in the oceanic water column down to abyssopelagic layers. In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and ~39% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40%, 11%, and 10%, respectively, of relative protein abundances. The in situ expression of solute transporters indicates that the heterotrophic prokaryotic community is geared toward the utilization of similar organic compounds throughout the water column, with yet higher abundances of transporters targeting aromatic compounds in the bathypelagic realm.

Microbially mediated decomposition of particulate organic carbon (POC) is a central component of the oceanic carbon cycle, controlling the flux of organic carbon from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. Yet, the specific microbial taxa responsible for POC decomposition and degradation in the deep ocean are still unknown. To target the active microbial lineages involved in these processes, <sup>13</sup> C-labeled particulate organic matter (POM) was used as a substrate to incubate particle-attached (PAM) and free-living microbial (FLM) assemblages from the epi- and bathypelagic zones of the New Britain Trench (NBT). By combining DNA stable-isotope probing and Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene, we identified 14 active bacterial taxonomic groups that implicated in the decomposition of <sup>13</sup> C-labeled POM at low and high pressures under the temperature of 15C. Our results show that both PAM and FLM were able to decompose POC and assimilate the released DOC. However, similar bacterial taxa in both the PAM and FLM assemblages were involved in POC decomposition and DOC degradation, suggesting the decoupling between microbial lifestyles and ecological functions. Microbial decomposition of POC and degradation of DOC were accomplished primarily by particle-attached bacteria at atmospheric pressure and by free-living bacteria at high pressures. Overall, the POC degradation rates were higher at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) than at high pressures (20 and 40 MPa) under 15C. Our results provide direct evidence linking the specific particle-attached and free-living bacterial lineages to decomposition and degradation of diatomic detritus at low and high pressures and identified the potential mediators of POC fluxes in the epi- and bathypelagic zones.

MGYS00004239	Organic matter from melting Arctic sea ice triggers bacterioplankton activity and diversity	As Arctic multiyear ice is being replaced with first-year sea ice, a key question pertains to the cycling and fate of the increasingly dominant first-year ice carbon upon its release into the water column during melt. In this study, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that changes in sea ice dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions affect the response of under-ice microbial communities and, as a corollary, the cycling of sea ice carbon in surface waters.Size-fractionated DOM fractions were isolated from first-year ice, producing three pools of dissolved organic carbon comprising the full DOM spectrum, large exopolymeric substances (EPS > 100 KDa molecular weight), and small EPS (< 100 KDa and > 10 KDa molecular weight). Enrichment experiments with these fractions revealed, over a 216 h period, significant and contrasting changes in prokaryotic abundance and production, substrate utilization rates, and microbial diversity between enrichments. The different DOM fractions differed in terms of molecular composition, elemental ratios and carbohydrate contribution, with the full DOM spectrum showing the highest proportion of carbohydrates and highest number of low-molecular weight unique compounds. Despite an abundance of low-molecular weight compounds in the DOM enrichment, the EPS fractions induced the strongest and fastest response of underice microbial communities, with highest growth rates and substrate utilization for the small EPS fraction. Shifts in microbial diversity were also observed over the course of the experiment, resulting in different community composition between enrichments. Notably, the EPS and DOM enrichments led to a dominance of Colwellia and Psychromonas, respectively.The results support our hypothesis, showing the fundamental role of the composition of the sea ice dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool and its dual impact, through changes in microbial diversity and substrate utilization, on organic matter cycling at the sea-ice interface. These findings have far-reaching consequences in terms of the cycling and export of sea ice associated carbon in the climatically-impacted Arctic and its role in global biogeochemical cycles.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine

"<i>Candidatus</i> Actinomarinales" was defined as a subclass of exclusively marine <i>Actinobacteria</i> with small cells and genomes. We have collected all the available genomes in databases to assess the diversity included in this group and analyzed it by comparative genomics. We have found the equivalent of five genera and 18 genomospecies. They have genome reduction parameters equal to those of freshwater actinobacterial "<i>Candidatus</i> Nanopelagicales" or marine alphaproteobacterial <i>Pelagibacterales</i> Genome recruitment shows that they are found only in the photic zone and mainly in surface waters, with only one genus that is found preferentially at or below the deep chlorophyll maximum. "<i>Ca</i> Actinomarinales" show a highly conserved core genome (80% of the gene families conserved for the whole order) with a saturation of genomic diversity of the flexible genome at the genomospecies level. We found only a flexible genomic island preserved throughout the order; it is related to the sugar decoration of the envelope and uses several tRNAs as hot spots to increase its genomic diversity. Populations had a discrete level of sequence diversity similar to other marine microbes but drastically different from the much higher levels found for <i>Pelagibacterales</i> Genomic analysis suggests that they are all aerobic photoheterotrophs with one type 1 rhodopsin and a heliorhodopsin. Like other actinobacteria, they possess the F420 coenzyme biosynthesis pathway, and its lower reduction potential could provide access to an increased range of redox chemical transformations. Last, sequence analysis revealed the first "<i>Ca</i> Actinomarinales" phages, including a prophage, with metaviromic islands related to sialic acid cleavage.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbiology is in a new age in which sequence databases are primary sources of information about many microbes. However, in-depth analysis of environmental genomes thus retrieved is essential to substantiate the new knowledge. Here, we study 182 genomes belonging to the only known exclusively marine pelagic group of the phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i> The aquatic branch of this phylum is largely known from environmental sequencing studies (single-amplified genomes [SAGs] and metagenome-assembled genomes [MAGs]), and we have collected and analyzed the available information present in databases about the "<i>Ca.</i> Actinomarinales." They are among the most streamlined microbes to live in the epipelagic zone of the ocean, and their study is critical to obtain a proper view of the diversity of <i>Actinobacteria</i> and their role in aquatic ecosystems.	33024052	The Evolutionary Success of the Marine Bacterium SAR11 Analyzed through a Metagenomic Perspective.	The SAR11 clade of <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> is the most abundant group of planktonic cells in the near-surface epipelagic waters of the ocean, but the mechanisms underlying its exceptional success have not been fully elucidated. Here, we applied a metagenomic approach to explore microdiversity patterns by measuring the accumulation of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations as well as homologous recombination in populations of SAR11 from different aquatic habitats (marine epipelagic, bathypelagic, and surface freshwater). The patterns of mutation accumulation and recombination were compared to those of other groups of representative marine microbes with multiple ecological strategies that share the same marine habitat, namely, <i>Cyanobacteria</i> (<i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i>), <i>Archaea</i> ("<i>Candidatus</i> Nitrosopelagicus" and Marine Group II <i>Thalassoarchaea</i>), and some heterotrophic marine bacteria (<i>Alteromonas</i> and <i>Erythrobacter</i>). SAR11 populations showed widespread recombination among distantly related members, preventing divergence leading to a genetically stable population. Moreover, their high intrapopulation sequence diversity with an enrichment in synonymous replacements supports the idea of a very ancient divergence and the coexistence of multiple different clones. However, other microbes analyzed seem to follow different evolutionary dynamics where processes of diversification driven by geographic and ecological instability produce a higher number of nonsynonymous replacements and lower intrapopulation sequence diversity. Together, these data shed light on some of the evolutionary and ecological processes that lead to the large genomic diversity in SAR11. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to other similar microbes that are difficult to culture in the laboratory, but abundant in nature, to investigate the underlying dynamics of their genomic evolution.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> As the most abundant bacteria in oceans, the <i>Pelagibacterales</i> order (here SAR11) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the study of the evolutionary forces driving its evolution has lagged considerably due to the inherent difficulty of obtaining pure cultures. Multiple evolutionary models have been proposed to explain the diversification of distinct lineages within a population; however, the identification of many of these patterns in natural populations remains mostly enigmatic. We have used a metagenomic approach to explore microdiversity patterns in their natural habitats. Comparison with a collection of bacterial and archaeal groups from the same environments shows that SAR11 populations have a different evolutionary regime, where multiple genotypes coexist within the same population and remain stable over time. Widespread homologous recombination could be one of the main driving factors of this homogenization.	31840364	Ecogenomics of the SAR11 clade.	Members of the SAR11 clade, despite their high abundance, are often poorly represented by metagenome-assembled genomes. This fact has hampered our knowledge about their ecology and genetic diversity. Here we examined 175 SAR11 genomes, including 47 new single-amplified genomes. The presence of the first genomes associated with subclade IV suggests that, in the same way as subclade V, they might be outside the proposed Pelagibacterales order. An expanded phylogenomic classification together with patterns of metagenomic recruitment at a global scale have allowed us to define new ecogenomic units of classification (genomospecies), appearing at different, and sometimes restricted, metagenomic data sets. We detected greater microdiversity across the water column at a single location than in samples collected from similar depth across the global ocean, suggesting little influence of biogeography. In addition, pangenome analysis revealed that the flexible genome was essential to shape genomospecies distribution. In one genomospecies preferentially found within the Mediterranean, a set of genes involved in phosphonate utilization was detected. While another, with a more cosmopolitan distribution, was unique in having an aerobic purine degradation pathway. Together, these results provide a glimpse of the enormous genomic diversity within this clade at a finer resolution than the currently defined clades.	30179232	Marine microbial metagenomes sampled across space and time.	Recent advances in understanding the ecology of marine systems have been greatly facilitated by the growing availability of metagenomic data, which provide information on the identity, diversity and functional potential of the microbial community in a particular place and time. Here we present a dataset comprising over 5 terabases of metagenomic data from 610 samples spanning diverse regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. One set of metagenomes, collected on GEOTRACES cruises, captures large geographic transects at multiple depths per station. The second set represents two years of time-series data, collected at roughly monthly intervals from 3 depths at two long-term ocean sampling sites, Station ALOHA and BATS. These metagenomes contain genomic information from a diverse range of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses. The data's utility is strengthened by the availability of extensive physical, chemical, and biological measurements associated with each sample. We expect that these metagenomes will facilitate a wide range of comparative studies that seek to illuminate new aspects of marine microbial ecosystems.

We propose that the distinctly different lithological and hydrothermal histories of these sediments, and their depositional contexts and changing quality and quantity of buried organic matter will affect the microbial community composition and activity.PI: Andreas Teske	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment	31554864	Characteristics and Evolution of sill-driven off-axis hydrothermalism in Guaymas Basin - the Ringvent site.	The Guaymas Basin spreading center, at 2000 m depth in the Gulf of California, is overlain by a thick sedimentary cover. Across the basin, localized temperature anomalies, with active methane venting and seep fauna exist in response to magma emplacement into sediments. These sites evolve over thousands of years as magma freezes into doleritic sills and the system cools. Although several cool sites resembling cold seeps have been characterized, the hydrothermally active stage of an off-axis site was lacking good examples. Here, we present a multidisciplinary characterization of Ringvent, an ~1 km wide circular mound where hydrothermal activity persists ~28 km northwest of the spreading center. Ringvent provides a new type of intermediate-stage hydrothermal system where off-axis hydrothermal activity has attenuated since its formation, but remains evident in thermal anomalies, hydrothermal biota coexisting with seep fauna, and porewater biogeochemical signatures indicative of hydrothermal circulation. Due to their broad potential distribution, small size and limited life span, such sites are hard to find and characterize, but they provide critical missing links to understand the complex evolution of hydrothermal systems.																																													
MGYS00005308	Analysis of plasmidome of high-altitude lakes from the Andean Puna	The high-altitude lakes of the Andean Puna are exposed to multiple extreme conditions including high UV radiation, high concentration of arsenic, heavy metals and dissolved salts, high thermal amplitude and low oxygen pressure. Despite inhospitable conditions, various microbial ecosystems can develop successfully through adaptation mechanisms, which can be encoded in plasmids and can thus be transmitted in the microbial community. The aim of this study was the characterization of plasmidome (overall plasmid population) of cultivable and non-cultivable organisms of lakes from the Andean Puna, analyzing their functions and ecological significance. Genetic determinants of plasmid nature essentials to survive in these environments were sought.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lake	32655530	First Report on the Plasmidome From a High-Altitude Lake of the Andean Puna.	Mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, drive the evolution of prokaryotic genomes through the horizontal transfer of genes allowing genetic exchange between bacteria. Moreover, plasmids carry accessory genes, which encode functions that may offer an advantage to the host. Thus, it is expected that in a certain ecological niche, plasmids are enriched in accessory functions, which are important for their hosts to proliferate in that niche. Puquio de Campo Naranja is a high-altitude lake from the Andean Puna exposed to multiple extreme conditions, including high UV radiation, alkalinity, high concentrations of arsenic, heavy metals, dissolved salts, high thermal amplitude and low O<sub>2</sub> pressure. Microorganisms living in this lake need to develop efficient mechanisms and strategies to cope under these conditions. The aim of this study was to characterize the plasmidome of microbialites from Puquio de Campo Naranja, and identify potential hosts and encoded functions using a deep-sequencing approach. The potential ecological impact of the plasmidome, including plasmids from cultivable and non-cultivable microorganisms, is described for the first time in a lake representing an extreme environment of the Puna. This study showed that the recovered genetic information for the plasmidome was novel in comparison to the metagenome derived from the same environment. The study of the total plasmid population allowed the identification of genetic features typically encoded by plasmids, such as resistance and virulence factors. The resistance genes comprised resistances to heavy metals, antibiotics and stress factors. These results highlight the key role of plasmids for their hosts and impact of extrachromosomal elements to thrive in a certain ecological niche.

Human impact on marine benthic communities has traditionally been assessed using visible morphological traits and has focused on the macrobenthos, whereas the ecologically important organisms of the meio- and microbenthos have received less attention. DNA metabarcoding offers an alternative to this approach and enables a larger fraction of the biodiversity in marine sediments to be monitored in a cost-efficient manner. Although this methodology remains poorly standardised and challenged by biases inherent to rRNA copy number variation, DNA extraction, PCR, and limitations related to taxonomic identification, it has been shown to be semi-quantitative and useful for comparing taxon abundances between samples. Here, we evaluate the effect of replicating genomic DNA extraction in order to counteract small scale spatial heterogeneity and improve diversity and community structure estimates in metabarcoding-based monitoring. For this purpose, we used ten technical replicates from three different marine sediment samples. The effect of sequence depth was also assessed, and in silico pooling of DNA extraction replicates carried out in order to maintain the number of reads constant. Our analyses demonstrated that both sequencing depth and DNA extraction replicates could improve diversity estimates as well as the ability to separate samples with different characteristics. We could not identify a "sufficient" replicate number or sequence depth, where further improvements had a less significant effect. Based on these results, we consider replication an attractive alternative to directly increasing the amount of sample used for DNA extraction and strongly recommend it for future metabarcoding studies and routine assessments of sediment biodiversity.

Below the seafloor at deep-sea hot springs, mixing of geothermal fluids with seawater supports a potentially vast microbial ecosystem. Although the identity of subseafloor microorganisms is largely known, their effect on deep-ocean biogeochemical cycles cannot be predicted without quantitative measurements of their metabolic rates and growth efficiency. Here, we report on incubations of subseafloor fluids under in situ conditions that quantitatively constrain subseafloor primary productivity, biomass standing stock, and turnover time. Single-cell-based activity measurements and 16S rRNA-gene analysis showed that <i>Campylobacteria</i> dominated carbon fixation and that oxygen concentration and temperature drove niche partitioning of closely related phylotypes. Our data reveal a very active subseafloor biosphere that fixes carbon at a rate of up to 321 myg C.L<sup>-1</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>, turns over rapidly within tens of hours, rivals the productivity of chemosynthetic symbioses above the seafloor, and significantly influences deep-ocean biogeochemical cycling.

Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a climatically active gas released into the atmosphere from oceans. It is produced mainly by bacterial enzymatic cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and six DMSP lyases have been identified to date. To determine the biogeographical distribution of bacteria relevant to DMS production, we investigated the diversity of dddP-the most abundant DMS-producing gene-in the northwestern Pacific Ocean using newly developed primers and the pyrosequencing method. Consistent with previous studies, the major dddP-containing bacteria in coastal areas were those belonging to the Roseobacter clade. However, genotypes closely related to the SAR116 group were found to represent a large portion of dddP-containing bacteria in the surface waters of the oligotrophic ocean. The addition of DMSP to a culture of the SAR116 strain Candidatus Puniceispirillum marinum IMCC1322 resulted in the production of DMS and upregulated expression of the dddP gene. Considering the large area of oligotrophic water and the wide distribution of the SAR116 group in oceans worldwide, we propose that these bacteria may play an important role in oceanic DMS production and biogeochemical sulfur cycles, especially via bacteria-mediated DMSP degradation.																																													
MGYS00004251	Microbial diversity of Oslo Fjord Pockmark sediments	The non-active pockmarks of the Oslo Fjord are excellent seabed features for studying the effects of geology on the microbial diversity. Geological features such as pockmarks effect the waterflow over the seabed. Here we studied the microbial communities from pockmarks sediments to understand how the diversity is affected by these structures.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Coastal:Sediment	24475066	Linking geology and microbiology: inactive pockmarks affect sediment microbial community structure.	Pockmarks are geological features that are found on the bottom of lakes and oceans all over the globe. Some are active, seeping oil or methane, while others are inactive. Active pockmarks are well studied since they harbor specialized microbial communities that proliferate on the seeping compounds. Such communities are not found in inactive pockmarks. Interestingly, inactive pockmarks are known to have different macrofaunal communities compared to the surrounding sediments. It is undetermined what the microbial composition of inactive pockmarks is and if it shows a similar pattern as the macrofauna. The Norwegian Oslofjord contains many inactive pockmarks and they are well suited to study the influence of these geological features on the microbial community in the sediment. Here we present a detailed analysis of the microbial communities found in three inactive pockmarks and two control samples at two core depth intervals. The communities were analyzed using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3 region. Microbial communities of surface pockmark sediments were indistinguishable from communities found in the surrounding seabed. In contrast, pockmark communities at 40 cm sediment depth had a significantly different community structure from normal sediments at the same depth. Statistical analysis of chemical variables indicated significant differences in the concentrations of total carbon and non-particulate organic carbon between 40 cm pockmarks and reference sample sediments. We discuss these results in comparison with the taxonomic classification of the OTUs identified in our samples. Our results indicate that microbial communities at the sediment surface are affected by the water column, while the deeper (40 cm) sediment communities are affected by local conditions within the sediment.

Members of the archaeal phylum <i>Bathyarchaeota</i> are among the most abundant microorganisms on Earth. Although versatile metabolic capabilities such as acetogenesis, methanogenesis, and fermentation have been suggested for bathyarchaeotal members, no direct confirmation of these metabolic functions has been achieved through growth of <i>Bathyarchaeota</i> in the laboratory. Here we demonstrate, on the basis of gene-copy numbers and probing of archaeal lipids, the growth of <i>Bathyarchaeota</i> subgroup Bathy-8 in enrichments of estuarine sediments with the biopolymer lignin.

MGYS00005864	Comparisons of microbial diversity over time in two different pH conditions in a geoduck hatchery.	For years, hatcheries in Washington (USA) and elsewhere have experienced unexplained mass mortality events in which entire cohorts of larvae do not survive through setting (transition from mobile larval to sessile juvenile phase). Investigations into known diseases, genetics, and water quality, among other factors, yield no direct correlations to these mortality events. Therefore, it has been proposed that more subtle shifts in the microbiome and/or water quality may be causing larval mortality. A full characterization of the resident microbial community (microbiome) in a hatchery could provide insight into the baseline microbiome and deviations from the baseline that may contribute to mortality events.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Marginal Sea	33902744	Coupled microbiome analyses highlights relative functional roles of bacteria in a bivalve hatchery.	Microbial communities are ubiquitous throughout ecosystems and are commensal with hosts across taxonomic boundaries. Environmental and species-specific microbiomes are instrumental in maintaining ecosystem and host health, respectively. The introduction of pathogenic microbes that shift microbiome community structure can lead to illness and death. Understanding the dynamics of microbiomes across a diversity of environments and hosts will help us to better understand which taxa forecast survival and which forecast mortality events. We characterized the bacterial community microbiome in the water of a commercial shellfish hatchery in Washington state, USA, where the hatchery has been plagued by recurring and unexplained larval mortality events. By applying the complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics we were able to more fully characterize the bacterial taxa in the hatchery at high (pH 8.2) and low (pH 7.1) pH that were metabolically active versus present but not contributing metabolically. There were shifts in the taxonomy and functional profile of the microbiome between pH and over time. Based on detected metagenomic reads and metaproteomic peptide spectral matches, some taxa were more metabolically active than expected based on presence alone (Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria) and some were less metabolically active than expected (e.g., Betaproteobacteria, Cytophagia). There was little correlation between potential and realized metabolic function based on Gene Ontology analysis of detected genes and peptides. The complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics contribute to a more full characterization of bacterial taxa that are potentially active versus truly metabolically active and thus impact water quality and inter-trophic relationships.																																													
MGYS00004096	Metazoan sequencing	The present study provides a new data on the diversity of nematodes communities in sub-marine canyon.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment	30083476	Co-occurring nematodes and bacteria in submarine canyon sediments.	In submarine canyon sediments, bacteria and nematodes dominate the benthic biomass and play a key role in nutrient cycling and energy transfer. The diversity of these communities remains, however, poorly studied. This work aims at describing the composition of bacteria and nematode communities in the Lacaze-Duthiers submarine canyon in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. We targeted three sediment depths for two consecutive years and investigated the communities using nuclear markers (18S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes). High throughput sequencing combined to maximal information coefficient (MIC) statistical analysis allowed us to identify, for the first time, at the same small scale, the community structures and the co-occurrence of nematodes and bacteria Operational Taxonomic Units across the sediment cores. The associations detected by MIC revealed marked patterns of co-occurrences between the bacteria and nematodes in the sediment of the canyon and could be linked to the ecological requirements of individual bacteria and nematodes. For the bacterial community, <i>Delta</i>- and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> sequences were the most abundant, as seen in some canyons earlier, although <i>Acidobacteria</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i> and <i>Planctomycetes</i> have been prevalent in other canyon sediments. The 20 identified nematode genera included bacteria feeders as <i>Terschellingia</i>, <i>Eubostrichus</i>, <i>Geomonhystera</i>, <i>Desmoscolex</i> and <i>Leptolaimus.</i> The present study provides new data on the diversity of bacterial and nematodes communities in the Lacaze-Duthiers canyon and further highlights the importance of small-scale sampling for an accurate vision of deep-sea communities.

Cold seeps are highly productive, fragmented marine ecosystems that form at the seafloor around hydrocarbon emission pathways. The products of microbial utilization of methane and other hydrocarbons fuel rich chemosynthetic communities at these sites, with much higher respiration rates compared with the surrounding deep-sea floor. Yet little is known as to the richness, composition and spatial scaling of bacterial communities of cold seeps compared with non-seep communities. Here we assessed the bacterial diversity across nine different cold seeps in the Eastern Mediterranean deep-sea and surrounding seafloor areas. Community similarity analyses were carried out based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) fingerprinting and high-throughput 454 tag sequencing and were combined with in situ and ex situ geochemical analyses across spatial scales of a few tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers. Seep communities were dominated by Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and shared, on average, 36% of bacterial types (ARISA OTUs (operational taxonomic units)) with communities from nearby non-seep deep-sea sediments. Bacterial communities of seeps were significantly different from those of non-seep sediments. Within cold seep regions on spatial scales of only tens to hundreds of meters, the bacterial communities differed considerably, sharing &lt;50% of types at the ARISA OTU level. Their variations reflected differences in porewater sulfide concentrations from anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons. This study shows that cold seep ecosystems contribute substantially to the microbial diversity of the deep-sea.

This study assessed the diversity and distribution of fungal communities in eight marine sediments of Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, High Arctic) using 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Sedimentary fungal communities showed high diversity with 42,219 reads belonging to 113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Of these OTUs, 62 belonged to the Ascomycota, 26 to Basidiomycota, 2 to Chytridiomycota, 1 to Zygomycota, 1 to Glomeromycota, and 21 to unknown fungi. The major known orders included Hypocreales and Saccharomycetales. The common fungal genera were Pichia, Fusarium, Alternaria, and Malassezia. Interestingly, most fungi occurring in these Arctic sediments may originate from the terrestrial habitats and different basins in Kongsfjorden (i.e., inner basin, central basin, and outer basin) harbor different sedimentary fungal communities. These results suggest the existence of diverse fungal communities in the Arctic marine sediments, which may serve as a useful community model for further ecological and evolutionary study of fungi in the Arctic.

Here we examined the impact of a commonly employed method used to measure nitrogen fixation, the acetylene reduction assay (ARA), on a marine sediment community. Historically, the ARA technique has been broadly employed for its ease of use, in spite of numerous known artifacts. To gauge the severity of these effects in a natural environment, we employed high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to detect differences in acetylene-treated sediments vs. non-treated control sediments after a 7 h incubation. Within this short time period, significant differences were seen across all activity of microbes identified in the sediment, implying that the changes induced by acetylene occur quickly. The results have important implications for our understanding of marine nitrogen budgets. Moreover, because the ARA technique has been widely used in terrestrial and freshwater habitats, these results may be applicable to other ecosystems.

MGYS00004126	A metagenetic approach for revealing community structure of marine planktonic copepods	Marine planktonic copepods are an ecologically important group with high species richness and abundance. Here, we propose a new metagenetic approach for revealing the community structure of marine planktonic copepods using 454 pyrosequencing of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA. We developed a method for clustering pyrosequencing data into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) through analysis of an artificial copepod community containing 33 morphologically identified species. The 99% similarity threshold had high species-level resolution for MOTU clustering but overestimated species richness. The artificial community was appropriately clustered into MOTUs at 97% similarity, with little inflation in MOTU numbers and with relatively high species-level resolution. The number of sequence reads per MOTU was correlated with dry weight of that taxon, suggesting that sequence reads could be used as a proxy for biomass. Next, we applied the method to field-collected samples, and the results corresponded reasonably well with morphological analysis of these communities. Numbers of MOTUs were well correlated with species richness at 97% similarity, and large numbers of sequence reads were generally observed in MOTUs derived from species with large biomass. MOTUs were successfully classified at the family level at 97% similarity; similar patterns of species richness and biomass within families were revealed with metagenetic and morphological analyses. At the 99% similarity threshold, MOTUs with high proportions of sequence reads were identified as biomass-dominant species in each field-collected sample. The metagenetic approach reported here can be an effective tool for rapid and comprehensive assessment of copepod community structure.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	24943089	A metagenetic approach for revealing community structure of marine planktonic copepods.

The number of sequence reads of each MOTU was correlated with dry weight of that taxon, suggesting that sequence reads could be used as a proxy for biomass. Next, we applied the method to field-collected samples, and the results corresponded reasonably well with morphological analysis of these communities. Numbers of MOTUs were well correlated with species richness at 97% similarity, and large numbers of sequence reads were generally observed in MOTUs derived from species with large biomass. Further, MOTUs were successfully classified into taxonomic groups at the family level at 97% similarity; similar patterns of species richness and biomass were revealed within families with metagenetic and morphological analyses. At the 99% similarity threshold, MOTUs with high proportions of sequence reads were identified as biomass-dominant species in each field-collected sample. The metagenetic approach reported here can be an effective tool for rapid and comprehensive assessment of copepod community structure.

MGYS00004487	Coral Spawn Degradation, Bocas del Toro, Panama - Raw sequence reads	The goal of this study was to identify bacterial communities that were labeled with a thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine, for investigating active bacterial communities during a coral mass-spawn degradation study off coastal Panama.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Coral reef	29884827	Bacterioplankton drawdown of coral mass-spawned organic matter.	Coral reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to microbial activities that result from dissolved organic matter (DOM) enrichment of their surrounding seawater. However, the response to particulate organic matter (POM) enrichment is less studied. In a microcosm experiment, we tested the response of bacterioplankton to a pulse of POM from the mass-spawning of Orbicella franksi coral off the Caribbean coast of Panama. Particulate organic carbon (POC), a proxy measurement for POM, increased by 40-fold in seawater samples collected during spawning; 68% degraded within 66 h. The elevation of multiple hydrolases presumably solubilized the spawn-derived POM into DOM. A carbon budget constructed for the 275 myM of degraded POC showed negligible change to the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), indicating that the DOM was readily utilized. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry shows that the DOM pool became enriched with heteroatom-containing molecules, a trend that suggests microbial alteration of organic matter. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that bacterial carbon demand could have accounted for a large proportion of the POC degradation. Further, using bromodeoxyuridine immunocapture in combination with 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, we surmise that actively growing bacterial groups were the primary degraders. We conclude that coral gametes are highly labile to bacteria and that such large capacity for bacterial degradation and alteration of organic matter has implications for coral reef health and coastal marine biogeochemistry.																																													
MGYS00004493	Microbial communities in the phycosphere environment	understand the mechanisms that shape microbial diversity in the algal bloom process	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine	29928265	Microbial Community Structure and Associations During a Marine Dinoflagellate Bloom.	Interactions between microorganisms and algae during bloom events significantly impacts their physiology, alters ambient chemistry, and shapes ecosystem diversity. The potential role these interactions have in bloom development and decline are also of particular interest given the ecosystem impacts of algal blooms. We hypothesized that microbial community structure and succession is linked to specific bloom stages, and reflects complex interactions among taxa comprising the phycosphere environment. This investigation used pyrosequencing and correlation approaches to assess patterns and associations among bacteria, archaea, and microeukaryotes during a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate <i>Alexandrium catenella</i>. Within the bacterial community, <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> were predominant during the initial bloom stage, while <i>Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria</i>, and <i>Actinobacteria</i> were the most abundant taxa present during bloom onset and termination. In the archaea biosphere, methanogenic members were present during the early bloom period while the majority of species identified in the late bloom stage were ammonia-oxidizing archaea and <i>Halobacteriales</i>. Dinoflagellates were the major eukaryotic group present during most stages of the bloom, whereas a mixed assemblage comprising diatoms, green-algae, rotifera, and other microzooplankton were present during bloom termination. Temperature and salinity were key environmental factors associated with changes in bacterial and archaeal community structure, respectively, whereas inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphate were associated with eukaryotic variation. The relative contribution of environmental parameters measured during the bloom to variability among samples was 35.3%. Interaction analysis showed that Maxillopoda, Spirotrichea, Dinoflagellata, and <i>Halobacteria</i> were keystone taxa within the positive-correlation network, while <i>Halobacteria</i>, Dictyochophyceae, Mamiellophyceae, and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> were the main contributors to the negative-correlation network. The positive and negative relationships were the primary drivers of mutualist and competitive interactions that impacted algal bloom fate, respectively. Functional predictions showed that blooms enhance microbial carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and alter the sulfur cycle. Our results suggest that microbial community structure is strongly linked to bloom progression, although specific drivers of community interactions and responses are not well understood. The importance of considering biotic interactions (e.g., competition, symbiosis, and predation) when investigating the link between microbial ecological behavior and an algal bloom's trajectory is also highlighted.																																													
MGYS00004011	Microbial communities of methane seeps in shallow, porous sands off Elba	The methane cold seeps near Pomonte (Elba) are unique ecosystems situated in very shallow and porous coastal sands. We investigated the influence on hydrodynamics on microbial community structure and function. Understanding these ecosystems is important to estimate their role in carbon cycling and their emission of methane to the atmosphere.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment	27065954	Methane Seep in Shallow-Water Permeable Sediment Harbors High Diversity of Anaerobic Methanotrophic Communities, Elba, Italy.	The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a key biogeochemical process regulating methane emission from marine sediments into the hydrosphere. AOM is largely mediated by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and has mainly been investigated in deep-sea sediments. Here we studied methane seepage at four spots located at 12 m water depth in coastal, organic carbon depleted permeable sands off the Island of Elba (Italy). We combined biogeochemical measurements, sequencing-based community analyses and in situ hybridization to investigate the microbial communities of this environment. Increased alkalinity, formation of free sulfide and nearly stoichiometric methane oxidation and sulfate reduction rates up to 200 nmol g(-1) day(-1) indicated the predominance of sulfate-coupled AOM. With up to 40 cm thickness the zones of AOM activity were unusually large and occurred in deeper sediment horizons (20-50 cm below seafloor) as compared to diffusion-dominated deep-sea seeps, which is likely caused by advective flow of pore water due to the shallow water depth and permeability of the sands. Hydrodynamic forces also may be responsible for the substantial phylogenetic and unprecedented morphological diversity of AOM consortia inhabiting these sands, including the clades ANME-1a/b, ANME-2a/b/c, ANME-3, and their partner bacteria SEEP-SRB1a and SEEP-SRB2. High microbial dispersal, the availability of diverse energy sources and high habitat heterogeneity might explain that the emission spots shared few microbial taxa, despite their physical proximity. Although the biogeochemistry of this shallow methane seep was very different to that of deep-sea seeps, their key functional taxa were very closely related, which supports the global dispersal of key taxa and underlines strong selection by methane as the predominant energy source. Mesophilic, methane-fueled ecosystems in shallow-water permeable sediments may comprise distinct microbial habitats due to their unique biogeochemical and physical characteristics. To link AOM phylotypes with seep habitats and to enable future meta-analyses we thus propose that seep environment ontology needs to be further specified.

The compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), made by many marine organisms, is one of Earth's most abundant organosulfur molecules. Many marine bacteria import DMSP and can degrade it as a source of carbon and/or sulfur via DMSP cleavage or DMSP demethylation pathways, which can generate the climate active gases dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or methanthiol (MeSH), respectively. Here we used culture-dependent and -independent methods to study bacteria catabolizing DMSP in the East China Sea (ECS). Of bacterial isolates, 42.11% showed DMSP-dependent DMS (Ddd<sup>+</sup>) activity, and 12.28% produced detectable levels of MeSH. Interestingly, although most Ddd<sup>+</sup> isolates were <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> (mainly Roseobacters), many gram-positive <i>Actinobacteria</i> were also shown to cleave DMSP producing DMS. The mechanism by which these <i>Actinobacteria</i> cleave DMSP is unknown, since no known functional <i>ddd</i> genes have been identified in genome sequences of Ddd<sup>+</sup> <i>Microbacterium</i> and <i>Agrococcus</i> isolates or in any other sequenced <i>Actinobacteria</i> genomes. Gene probes to the DMSP demethylation gene <i>dmdA</i> and the DMSP lyase gene <i>dddP</i> demonstrated that these DMSP-degrading genes are abundant and widely distributed in ECS seawaters. <i>dmdA</i> was present in relatively high proportions in both surface (19.53% +/- 6.70%) and bottom seawater bacteria (16.00% +/- 8.73%). In contrast, <i>dddP</i> abundance positively correlated with chlorophyll <i>a</i>, and gradually decreased with the distance from land, which implies that the bacterial DMSP lyase gene <i>dddP</i> might be from bacterial groups that closely associate with phytoplankton. Bacterial community analysis showed positive correlations between <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> abundance and concentrations of DMS and DMSP, further confirming the link between this abundant bacterial class and the environmental DMSP cycling.																																													
MGYS00005140	metatranscriptomic approaches to unravel taxonomic and functional diversities of a coastal aquatic ecosystem and their reaction to hypoxia	Two previous integrative research programs: PREDHYPO (AMIDEX Foundation 2015-2016) and PREDHYP-O2 (EC2CO 2016-2017, CNRS-INSU) have enabled the coupling between physics and biogeochemical processes of the Berre lagoon sediment during laboratory experiments under controlled oxygenation conditions. These programs have also initiated regular in situ measurements during a three-year period, leading to the first-step development of a 1D predictive benthic-pelagic biogeochemical model of the lagoon. We set up a laboratory experiment to follow the biological and chemical dynamics at the sediment-water interface on the short-term period (i.e. one month incubation of sediment core samples), while we conducted an in situ approach to characterize seasonal and yearly dynamics (i.e. from may 2015 to august 2016) of biogeochemical processes at the sediment-water interface for three sites showing contrasted oxygenation conditions. Because microorganisms are key actors of biogeochemical processes and organic matter turnover, we dedicated an important part of these research programs to the characterization of taxonomic and functional responses of the sediment microbiome to hypoxia events. Based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies (i.e. ILLUMINA), we developed a metabarcoding approach that aims at exploring taxonomic diversity of Bacteria and Archaea living in the sediment, and we developed a metatranscriptomic approach that aims at identifying metabolic activities and pathways involved in the ecosystem functions. The laboratory experiment considered triplicate samples of sediment at various depth layers and according to oxygenation conditions of the water column ranging from 0% to 100%.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

MGYS00004300	Uncultered bacterium Targeted Locus (Loci)	In the context of global warming in the Arctic environment greater understanding of microbial-driven processes related to sediment and hydric transfers is of major importance where these are linked to erosion processes. To add to the research in this area, we investigated the structure of sedimentary microbial communities from three distinct samples collected along a short Glacier-River-Fjord transect in Kongsfjorden (Fjord of Svalbard) at the beginning of the active thaw using a metagenomic approach. A methodological approach was used based on the pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes coupled with multiple DNA extractions to overcome major methodological biases, namely DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Sediment

A hypoxic/suboxic brine pool at a depth of about 850 m was discovered near the Thuwal cold seeps in the Red Sea. Filled with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, such a brine pool might limit the spread of eukaryotic organisms. Here, we compared the communities of the eukaryotic microbes in a microbial mat, sediments and water samples distributed in 7 sites within and adjacent to the brine pool. Taxonomic classification of the pyrosequenced 18S rRNA amplicon reads showed that fungi highly similar to the species identified along the Arabic coast were almost ubiquitous in the water and sediment samples, supporting their wide distribution in various environments. The microbial mat displayed the highest species diversity and contained grazers and a considerable percentage of unclassified species. Phylogeny-based methods revealed novel lineages representing a majority of the reads from the interface between the sea water and brine pool. Phylogenetic relationships with more reference sequences suggest that the lineages were affiliated with novel Alveolata and Euglenozoa inhabiting the interface where chemosynthetic prokaryotes are highly proliferative due to the strong chemocline and halocline. The brine sediments harbored abundant species highly similar to invertebrate gregarine parasites identified in different oxygen-depleted sediments. Therefore, the present findings support the uniqueness of some microbial eukaryotic groups in this cold seep brine system.

Basin-fill aquifers of the Southwestern United States are associated with elevated concentrations of arsenic (As) in groundwater. Many private domestic wells in the Cache Valley Basin, UT, have As concentrations in excess of the U.S. EPA drinking water limit. Thirteen sediment cores were collected from the center of the valley at the depth of the shallow groundwater and were sectioned into layers based on redoxmorphic features. Three of the layers, two from redox transition zones and one from a depletion zone, were used to establish microcosms. Microcosms were treated with groundwater (GW) or groundwater plus glucose (GW+G) to investigate the extent of As reduction in relation to iron (Fe) transformation and characterize the microbial community structure and function by sequencing 16S rRNA and arsenate dissimilatory reductase (arrA) genes. Under the carbon-limited conditions of the GW treatment, As reduction was independent of Fe reduction, despite the abundance of sequences related to Geobacter and Shewanella, genera that include a variety of dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria. The addition of glucose, an electron donor and carbon source, caused substantial shifts toward domination of the bacterial community by Clostridium-related organisms, and As reduction was correlated with Fe reduction for the sediments from the redox transition zone. The arrA gene sequencing from microcosms at day 54 of incubation showed the presence of 14 unique phylotypes, none of which were related to any previously described arrA gene sequence, suggesting a unique community of dissimilatory arsenate-respiring bacteria in the Cache Valley Basin.																																													
MGYS00004649	Arctic Microbial response to oil and Corexit	The fate of oil and oil spill response chemicals in the Arctic is of critical importance as marine shipping and oil exploration are increasing due to receding sea ice cover. Using indigenous Arctic marine organisms in freshly collected seawater, we identified of bacterial taxa that increase in relative abundance in response to both oil and Corexit in Arctic seawater, suggesting that some taxa biodegrade components of both oil and dispersant. We then paried these microbial analyses with the chemical loss of oil and the surfactant components of Corexit 9500. These results allow for the first comparison between Arctic and temperate environments in regards to the fate of Corexit and the microbes involved in biodegrading dispersants and oil.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Freshwater:Lotic:Sediment

Subterranean estuaries (STEs) have been recognized as important ecosystems for the exchange of materials between the land and sea, but the microbial players of biogeochemical processes have not been well examined. In this study, we investigated the bacterial and archaeal communities within 10 cm depth intervals of a permeable sediment core (100 cm in length) collected from a STE located at Gloucester Point (GP-STE), VA, United States. High throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and subsequent bioinformatics analyses were conducted to examine the composition, diversity, and potential functions of the sediment communities. The community composition varied significantly from the surface to a depth of 100 cm with up to 13,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence identities. More than 95% of the sequences consisted of bacterial OTUs, while the relative abundances of archaea, dominated by Crenarchaea, gradually increased with sediment core depth. Along the redox gradients of GP-STE, differential distribution of ammonia- and methane-oxidizing, denitrifying, and sulfate reducing bacteria was observed as well as methanogenic archaea based on predicted microbial functions. The aerobic-anaerobic transition zone (AATZ) had the highest diversity and abundance of microorganisms, matching with the predicted functional diversity. This indicates the AATZ as a hotspot of biogeochemical processes of STEs. The physical and geochemical gradients in different depths have attributed to vertical stratification of microbial community composition and function in the GP-STE.																																													
MGYS00005850	Ecological Genomics of a Seasonally Anoxic Fjord; Saanich Inlet	Saanich Inlet is a seasonally anoxic fjord opening to the Strait of Georgia on the southeast coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It is approximately 24 kilometers long with a maximal basin depth of 234 meters and receives limited freshwater input from the surrounding watershed. A shallow glacial entrance sill 75 meters deep restricts circulation within interior and basin waters for most of the year. During spring and summer months, restricted circulation combined with high levels of primary productivity in surface waters lead to oxygen loss with concomitant water column stratification indicated by accumulation of methane (CH4), Ammonia (NH3) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). In late summer and fall, oxygenated nutrient-rich ocean waters upwelling through the Strait cascade into Saanich Inlet shoaling anoxic bottom waters upward and transforming the redox chemistry of the water column. This process is stable on decadal time scales exhibiting a relatively narrow deviation in the depth distribution of the oxycline at different times of year. The recurring seasonal development of water column anoxia followed by deep-water renewal enables spatiotemporal profiling of microbial community structure and function across a wide range of water column redox states.	root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Estuary
