Atmospheric depositions include pollutants or nutrients from human activities that are deposited onto ecosystems via precipitation or dry deposition, potentially influenced by climate change through altered weather patterns. Therefore, the study's focus on how these atmospheric changes impact a microbiome process (dinitrogen fixation) aligns with assessing interactions between climate-related factors and microbiomes.",

It analyzes how these external factors (dust and aerosols) affect a specific component of the marine microbiome. While the study does not directly mention climate change or assess its effects, the phenomena it examines—such as the deposition of Saharan dust—are influenced by climate patterns and can be linked to climate variability and changes in atmospheric circulation due to global warming. Aerosol and dust movements are affected by changing weather patterns, which are a consequence of climate change. Therefore, although the study's primary focus is not explicitly on climate change, its subject matter has relevant connections to how climate dynamics impact marine microbiomes.",
