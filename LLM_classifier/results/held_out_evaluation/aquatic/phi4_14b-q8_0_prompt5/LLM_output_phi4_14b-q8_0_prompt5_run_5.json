            "explanation": "The study described involves evaluating the impact of atmospheric depositions on dinitrogen fixation in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea using a mesocosm approach. Dinitrogen fixation is a microbiome process where certain microorganisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by living organisms, which is crucial for marine ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition can be influenced by climate change due to factors such as increased frequency of storms or changes in precipitation patterns that affect the transport and deposition of nutrients and other materials from the atmosphere to aquatic systems. If these changes in atmospheric depositions are driven by climate change, they could impact microbial processes like dinitrogen fixation, which in turn can influence marine nutrient cycles and carbon sequestration. Therefore, this study is indirectly related to understanding how climate change affects a microbiome process.",
