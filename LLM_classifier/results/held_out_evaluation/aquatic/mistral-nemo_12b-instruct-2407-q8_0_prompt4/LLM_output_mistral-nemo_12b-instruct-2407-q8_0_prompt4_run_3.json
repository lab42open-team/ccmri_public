Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "The text mentions accumulation of methane (CH4) due to oxygen loss in Saanich Inlet, which is related to climate change as methane is a potent greenhouse gas.",
