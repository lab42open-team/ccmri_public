Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",

            "explanation": "The text mentions the impact of receding sea ice cover, which is related to climate change, on marine shipping and oil exploration in the Arctic. Additionally, it discusses the biodegradation of oil and dispersants by microbial communities, but does not directly state that these microbial processes contribute to climate change or are influenced by it beyond the context of changing environmental conditions due to receding sea ice.",
