            "explanation": "The text discusses the biogeography of Arctic picoeukaryotes and how their distribution is related to environmental conditions, particularly mentioning the record sea ice minimum in 2012. It suggests that changes in environmental conditions could lead to shifts in biodiversity and biomass of these microorganisms, potentially altering biogeochemical cycles in the central Arctic Ocean. Although the text does not explicitly state climate change as a factor influencing microbial communities or vice versa, it implies environmental change due to sea ice minimums, which are associated with climate change.

Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated.

            "explanation": "The text describes the microbial communities and processes within permeable intertidal sediment, focusing on their roles in biogeochemical processes along geochemical gradients. However, it does not explicitly state that climate change influences these microbiome communities or microbial processes (CC -> MB) nor does it claim that these microbial communities/processes contribute to climate change (MB -> CC). The text primarily details the composition and function of microbial communities without linking them directly to climate change.",
