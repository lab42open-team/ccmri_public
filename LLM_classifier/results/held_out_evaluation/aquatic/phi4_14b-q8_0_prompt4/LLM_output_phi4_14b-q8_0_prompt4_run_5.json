You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",

            "explanation": "The text discusses how microbial communities respond to oil and Corexit in Arctic environments, suggesting that certain bacterial taxa can biodegrade these substances. While the primary focus is on microbial response rather than climate change, the context of increasing marine shipping and oil exploration due to receding sea ice cover indirectly relates to climate change influences (CC -> MB). The melting sea ice is a consequence of climate change, which impacts microbiome activities related to oil spill responses.",
