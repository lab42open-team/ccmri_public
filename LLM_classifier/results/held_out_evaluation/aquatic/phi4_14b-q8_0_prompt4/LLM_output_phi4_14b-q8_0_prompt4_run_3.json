Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",

            "explanation": "The text describes characterizing microbial communities associated with Eurasian watermilfoil in freshwater lakes, focusing on environmental and aquatic aspects without mentioning any direct influence of climate change on these microbial communities or processes, nor does it describe how these microbial communities might contribute to climate change. Therefore, the text is not directly related to climate change.",

The study focuses on the composition, diversity, and functions of microbial communities along geochemical gradients in a subterranean estuary without reference to climate change.
