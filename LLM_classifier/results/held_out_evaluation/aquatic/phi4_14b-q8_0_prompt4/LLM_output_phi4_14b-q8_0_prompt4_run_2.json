Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",

            "explanation": "The text describes characterizing microbial communities associated with Eurasian watermilfoil, water, and sediment in freshwater lakes in Minnesota, USA. There is no mention of climate change influencing these microbiome communities or processes (CC -> MB), nor is there any indication that these microbial communities or processes contribute to climate change (MB -> CC). Therefore, the text is not directly related to climate change.",

It mentions biogeochemical processes like ammonia oxidation, methane oxidation, denitrification, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis but does not explicitly state how these processes or the microbial community contribute to climate change (MB -> CC) or are influenced by it (CC -> MB). Therefore, there is no direct mention of a relationship between climate change and microbial communities or processes in this context.",
