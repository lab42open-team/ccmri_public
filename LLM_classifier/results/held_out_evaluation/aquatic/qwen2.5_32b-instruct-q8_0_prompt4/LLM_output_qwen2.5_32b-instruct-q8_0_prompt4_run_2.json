        "Prompt": "prompt4\tIs this text related to climate change directly? Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "The text describes a metagenomic analysis of microorganisms from Movile Cave, focusing on the genome assembly of Thiovulum sp. There is no mention of climate change influencing microbiome communities or processes, nor does it state that microbial communities/processes contribute to climate change.",
