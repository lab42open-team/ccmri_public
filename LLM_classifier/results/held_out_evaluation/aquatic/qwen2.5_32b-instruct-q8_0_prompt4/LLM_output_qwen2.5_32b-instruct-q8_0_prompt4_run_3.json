Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "The text does not mention any direct influence of climate change on microbiome communities or microbial processes, nor does it state that microbial communities/processes contribute to climate change.",
            "answer": "***no***"
        }
    }
