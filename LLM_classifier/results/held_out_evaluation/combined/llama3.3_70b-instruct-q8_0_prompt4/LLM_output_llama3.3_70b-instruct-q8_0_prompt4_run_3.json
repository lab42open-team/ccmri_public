            "explanation": "The text does not explicitly mention climate change, but it discusses the nitrogen cycle in marine sediments and the role of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in this process. Although temperature is mentioned as a factor influencing AOA and AOB communities, there is no direct link to climate change. However, considering the broader context where microbial processes like ammonia oxidation can be influenced by or contribute to changes in the environment, including those related to climate, it's worth noting. Still, based on the strict criteria given that require explicit mention of climate change influencing microbiome communities or vice versa, this text does not qualify.",
