Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",

            "explanation": "The text describes microbial processes and their distribution in subterranean estuaries, which are important for the exchange of materials between land and sea. However, it does not explicitly mention how these processes contribute to or are influenced by climate change.",
