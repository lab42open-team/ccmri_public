Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated.

            "explanation": "The text discusses the microbial community in intertidal sediment and its biogeochemical processes, which can be indirectly related to climate change through the exchange of materials between land and sea and the processes involving methane-oxidizing, denitrifying, and sulfate-reducing bacteria. However, it does not explicitly state a direct influence of climate change on the microbiome or vice versa.",
