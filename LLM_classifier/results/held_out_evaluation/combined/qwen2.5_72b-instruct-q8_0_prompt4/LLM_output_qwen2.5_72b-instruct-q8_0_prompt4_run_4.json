        "Prompt": "prompt4\tIs this text related to climate change directly? Instructions: If in the text is mentioned that climate change (CC) influences a microbiome (MB) community or microbial process (CC -> MB) or if microbial communities/processes contribute to Climate Change (MB -> CC). Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated. You can type a short explanation for your answer and then answer strictly with '***yes***' (if related) or '***no***' (if unrelated) in the next line. If you are unsure, answer '***no***'.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "The text describes the ecological genomics of a seasonally anoxic fjord, Saanich Inlet, focusing on microbial community structure and function in response to seasonal changes in redox conditions. While it does not explicitly mention climate change or its direct influence on the microbiome or vice versa, the processes described (e.g., oxygen loss, upwelling) can be influenced by broader climatic factors. However, based on the strict criteria provided, there is no explicit statement linking these microbial processes to climate change.",
