A study is defined as related to climate change if it analyzes how climate change affects a microbiome or microbiome process, or if it analyzes how a microbiome or microbiome process affects climate change. For each study, you should first provide your explanation and reasoning, followed by your final answer, which must be ***yes** or **no**.",
