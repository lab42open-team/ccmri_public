        "Prompt": "prompt5\tYou are a climate change expert. I will provide you with a text describing a microbiome study, and your job is to assess if the study is related to climate change. A study is defined as related to climate change if it analyzes how climate change affects a microbiome or microbiome process, or if it analyzes how a microbiome or microbiome process affects climate change. For each study, you should first provide your explanation and reasoning, followed by your final answer, which must be ***yes** or **no**.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "The study is focused on the metagenomics assembly of the microbiome in cultivated corn soil from Kansas, which does not explicitly relate to climate change. However, since it involves soil biome analysis, it could be indirectly related by studying how changes in agricultural practices or land use (potentially influenced by climate change) affect soil microbial communities.",
