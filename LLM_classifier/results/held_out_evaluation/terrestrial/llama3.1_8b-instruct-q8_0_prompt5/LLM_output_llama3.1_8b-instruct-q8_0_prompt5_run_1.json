        "Prompt": "prompt5\tYou are a climate change expert. I will provide you with a text describing a microbiome study, and your job is to assess if the study is related to climate change. A study is defined as related to climate change if it analyzes how climate change affects a microbiome or microbiome process, or if it analyzes how a microbiome or microbiome process affects climate change. For each study, you should first provide your explanation and reasoning, followed by your final answer, which must be ***yes** or **no**.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "The study is focused on the metagenomics assembly of corn soil from Kansas, which does not explicitly mention climate change or its effects on microbiomes or vice versa.",
            "answer": "***no***"
        }

            "explanation": "This study involves comparative metagenome analysis of normal and arsenic contaminated soils, but it doesn't mention climate change as a factor affecting the microbiomes or vice versa. It appears to be focused on understanding the impact of arsenic contamination on microbial communities in soil.",
