        "Prompt": "prompt5\tYou are a climate change expert. I will provide you with a text describing a microbiome study, and your job is to assess if the study is related to climate change. A study is defined as related to climate change if it analyzes how climate change affects a microbiome or microbiome process, or if it analyzes how a microbiome or microbiome process affects climate change. For each study, you should first provide your explanation and reasoning, followed by your final answer, which must be ***yes** or **no**.",
        "Response": {
            "explanation": "This study is related to climate change as it investigates benzene degradation processes in subsurface environments contaminated by fuel hydrocarbons, which can be affected by climate change.",
            "answer": "***yes***"
