Both are considered CC-related in this context, meaning that you will mark this text as climate-change-related if either or both is stated.

However, since one of the potential sources of resistant phenotypes mentioned in the text is 'environmental resistomes', which might be influenced by climate change, this could be considered a tangential connection. Nevertheless, this connection is indirect and subtle.",
